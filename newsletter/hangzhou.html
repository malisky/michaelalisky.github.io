        <p>At 6am, Rahul and I took a walk around the fog-adorned Xihu, or West Lake. We reflected on life, love, and Stanford, and we saw many old people and a few Douyin influencers. I think old people have it pretty good in China. They hang out together, practice <em>tai chi</em>, play cards, gossip. Ninety percent of China's elderly receive care at home, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-ages-investors-bet-they-can-beat-retirement-home-stigma-2023-03-03/">compared</a> with 3% in nursing homes and 7% in community-level assistance facilities. We stopped to chat with a few garrulous old men, and the hazy mountains around Xihu were indeed marvelous in the rain.</p>

        <p>Xihu is the crown jewel of Hangzhou, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has inspired poets and painters for over a thousand years. It's basically the city's beating heart, and part of the reason why Marco Polo once called Hangzhou "the finest and most splendid city in the world." I can only imagine what he might have said if he had seen Aurora, Colorado.</p>

        <p>At a tea farm in the outskirts of Hangzhou, I also met a nice cat (did not catch her name unfortunately).</p>

        <p>Here's a shot of me roasting fresh Longjing (Dragon Well) tea, which Hangzhou is famous for. Apparently, all six types of tea can be made from the same leaf: green, white, yellow, oolong, black, and red. Like most things in life, it all comes down to one's oxidation levels and determination.</p>

        <p>The workers were impressed with my technique; they said they had never seen a foreigner as talented as me. I humbly accepted their praise and tactfully turned down a push to name me the town's mayor (to the uninitiated, I am joking, but village elections in China are surprisingly <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/abs/elections-and-power-the-locus-of-decisionmaking-in-chinese-villages/A6803EB814F116998B87C478EB1596E5">competitive</a>). I signed a few autographs, shook a few hands, and we departed for Shanghai.</p>
        
        <p>Before we left, though, the group decked out in traditional (and culturally appropriate) Peking Opera-style (<em>jingju</em>) makeup. I was Zhou Que, a cunning and treacherous villain, which I thought was fitting since people here really like it when I refer to myself as <em>yang guizi</em> (foreign devil).</p>

        <p>At the 'Doo Crafts' factory (the name could probably be better), we watched employees tape up boxes with mesmerizing, rhythmic precision that evinced no wasted movements. It was like watching Butcher Ding if he had traded his cleaver for tape dispensers and ox carcasses for DIY bead kits.</p>

        <blockquote class="poetry-quote">
          <p>Cook Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee — zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou music.</p>

        <p>Our last night in Hangzhou was spent at Gongyan, an immersive performance set during the Song Dynasty that told the story of <strong>Su Dongpo</strong> (also known as Su Shi), a poet, statesman, and once-governor of Hangzhou. It began with his marriage and quiet domestic happiness, followed by the death of his wife and his exile from court. Snow began to fall indoors. A single line of poetry pierced the silence, and in that moment of artificial winter and ancient verse, my mind was transported to those distant pre-Covid days of my freshman year at Stanford:</p>

        <blockquote class="poetry-quote">
          <p class="chinese">十年生死两茫茫，不思量，自难忘。</p>
          <p class="translation">"Ten years, dead and living dim and draw apart. I don't try to remember, but forgetting is hard."</p>

        <p>Also I take that back. The real highlight of Hangzhou was redeeming myself by sinking a game winner from 3 at the headquarters of Rockbros bike company. To those who have asked me what the shot felt like, I can only quote the late Kobe Bryant, who in a <a href="https://medium.com/@Najeeb/kobe-bryant-on-the-zone-5d9e3415126c" target="_blank">2015 interview</a> described "that flow where nothing else matters; Nothing else is important other than what I am doing in this moment and time, and it's a beautiful feeling."</p>
        
        <p>It was, unironically, also very wonderful to get to catch up with my friend Max over a bowl of green Mapo Tofu. My tongue was numbed and my heart was filled. Thanks for showing me around Zhejiang University!</p>

        <p>In Shanghai, I also got to see Christina (what an absolute ray of sunshine), and we all had drinks on a rooftop bar overlooking the Bund.</p>

        <p>At Xiaohongshu's headquarters, I pitched the team on several groundbreaking features that would revolutionize social media forever (they politely declined). When I pressed a company spokesperson about <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/douyin-xiaohongshu-other-platforms-tweak-algorithms-as-china-cracks-down-on-info-bubbles" target="_blank">recent</a> government-mandated algorithm adjustments, they suddenly remembered they had a very important meeting to attend. The office was nice though, with lots of plants and beanbags.</p>

        <p>Later that day, I also got scammed at a local market and went to a digital government service center to try to complain.</p>

        <p>The last time I was in Shanghai, I visited the marriage market in People’s Park, where old people gather to trade resumes of their children/grandchildren, replete with photos, salary, college education, and zodiac signs. One of the aunty-matchmakers grabbed me and said, "you have nice skin" (皮肤, pífū), but I misheard and thought she said "you have a nice 屁股 (pìgu)" and I got a little flustered.</p>
