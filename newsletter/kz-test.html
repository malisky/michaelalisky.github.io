        <p><em>First impressions of Kazakhstan</em></p>
        
        <p>This is my obligatory, "I'm still alive" check-in. I arrived in Almaty this morning at 4am. After a bit of small talk, my taxi driver, Alexei, asked if I was okay with a "—Å–ø–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å" (controversial question): "what do Americans think of Trump?" He compared Kazakhstan's aging president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, to Joe Biden (unlike Biden though, Tokayev speaks fluent Chinese).</p>
        
        <p>Alexei also taught me the word "–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ—É–ø–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π" (hard-headed) to describe how older politicians often grow out of touch with the needs of young people.</p>
        
        <p>Almaty has a very Russian feel, with no shortage of randomly placed Soviet statues, block-style apartments, and old men wearing oversized suits. Virtually everyone speaks Russian, but there've been renewed efforts to teach Kazakh in recent years.</p>

        <p>The city itself is stunning, full of trees and surrounded by the snow-capped Ile-Alatau mountains. I love how many parks there are.</p>
        
        <p>After checking into my apartment, I walked around for a few hours and ran some errands. I fed pigeons with an older woman from the North Caucasus, who informed me that Kazakh pigeons most strongly prefer pearl barley.</p>

        <p>I also stumbled on the vestigial remains of McDonalds, which arrived in Kazakhstan in 2016 but left in 2022 due to supply chain issues caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It looks like someone else is not so subtly using their branding.</p>

        <p>Also, my apartment's bed sheets match the walls, which I find very endearing.</p>

        <p>Until next time!</p>
