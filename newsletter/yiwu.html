    <p>The other day at the Shenzhen <a href="https://medium.com/chinafacture/huaqiangbei-the-biggest-electronics-market-in-the-world-shenzhen-china-3ec66e5d2df0" target="_blank">Huaqiangbei electronics market</a>, I became a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34KUIBsIUiPV7oCIzSdDAU?si=00c61a7504f54d65&nd=1&dlsi=fb39ad0ff4954a70" target="_blank">business, man,</a> after I helped two Ugandan traders negotiate down the price of solar-powered surveillance cameras. In return, they warmly promised to take me out for Waragi (moonshine made from bananas) if I’m ever in Kampala.</p>

    <p>Spanning 1.45 square kilometers and housing roughly 38,000 businesses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaqiangbei" target="_blank">Huaqiangbei</a> is the world’s largest electronics market. Vendors huddle inside to sell everything from smartphone components to drones, video games to car radios. In 1980, <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/blog-posts/why-was-shenzhen-chinas-most-successful-sez/" target="_blank">Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen a special economic zone</a>, allowing the city of 30,000 to experiment with export-driven industrialization and free-market capitalism. The year before, three military-industrial factories merged and relocated to Shenzhen, forming the Huaqiang Electronics Company. By the 1980s, concomitant assembly plants began to sprout up nearby, transforming the sleepy fishing village of Shenzhen into a bustling commercial-industrial hub (not a dig; I love both fishing and sleeping). From 1980 to 1984, Shenzhen’s GDP grew by an average of 58% per annum (compared to national growth rates of 10%)<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.26.4.57" target="_blank">.</a> The city’s population today is over 17 million.</p>

    <p>As I wandered through the electronic labyrinth, I chatted with vendors and bought a pair of cheap headphones. When I asked one woman how the economy was faring compared to 10 years ago, she laughed. “China has been developing continuously and will continue to grow!” I asked about Trump, and she waved the question off. “I’m not interested in American politics. I just do business!”</p>

    <p>Another vendor kindly offered to help me apply to <a href="https://jawlipops.tumblr.com/post/701387507648151552/from-the-chinese-dating-game-show-%E9%9D%9E%E8%AF%9A%E5%8B%BF%E6%89%B0-fei-cheng" target="_blank">Feicheng Wurao</a> <em>[If You Are the One]</em>, which is by far my favorite dating show. Essentially, a man presents his life story to 30 women who ask questions and buzz out whenever they become unimpressed, often triggered by details like salary, hobbies, or dating history. When I was in 6th grade, I once sent in an application to ABC’s The Bachelor, written from the perspective of my golden retriever, Sally: “Long blonde hair. Described by friends as ‘a bitch.’ Strangers can’t keep their hands off of me.”</p>

    <p>At Tencent’s headquarters, AI researchers discussed the impact of US export controls on domestic chip manufacturing. Tencent is China’s tech octopus, reaching into everything from gaming to fintech to social media, with WeChat functioning as a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@remyzeee/video/7289589985160826118" target="_blank">mega-app</a>-slash-pseudo-national operating system for daily life.</p>

    <p>At Huolala, a delivery company, the cofounder said he thinks you have to be a psychopath to run a startup. Having spent significant time around Stanford students, I think this observation is pretty astute.</p>

    <p>At a nearby driver training hub, I was struck by Party posters celebrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Bombs,_One_Satellite" target="_blank">两弹一星</a> (China’s first nuclear launch program). Even as a private company, Huolala encourages its drivers to view themselves as part of a broader social mission. During the pandemic, for instance, the company played a crucial part in distributing PPE and hand sanitizer.</p>
