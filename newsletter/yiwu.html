    <p>The other day at the Shenzhen <a href="https://medium.com/chinafacture/huaqiangbei-the-biggest-electronics-market-in-the-world-shenzhen-china-3ec66e5d2df0" target="_blank">Huaqiangbei electronics market</a>, I became a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34KUIBsIUiPV7oCIzSdDAU?si=00c61a7504f54d65&nd=1&dlsi=fb39ad0ff4954a70" target="_blank">business, man,</a> after I helped two Ugandan traders negotiate down the price of solar-powered surveillance cameras. In return, they warmly promised to take me out for Waragi (moonshine made from bananas) if I‚Äôm ever in Kampala.</p>

    <p>Spanning 1.45 square kilometers and housing roughly 38,000 businesses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaqiangbei" target="_blank">Huaqiangbei</a> is the world‚Äôs largest electronics market. Vendors huddle inside to sell everything from smartphone components to drones, video games to car radios. In 1980, <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/blog-posts/why-was-shenzhen-chinas-most-successful-sez/" target="_blank">Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen a special economic zone</a>, allowing the city of 30,000 to experiment with export-driven industrialization and free-market capitalism. The year before, three military-industrial factories merged and relocated to Shenzhen, forming the Huaqiang Electronics Company. By the 1980s, concomitant assembly plants began to sprout up nearby, transforming the sleepy fishing village of Shenzhen into a bustling commercial-industrial hub (not a dig; I love both fishing and sleeping). From 1980 to 1984, Shenzhen‚Äôs GDP grew by an average of 58% per annum (compared to national growth rates of 10%)<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.26.4.57" target="_blank">.</a> The city‚Äôs population today is over 17 million.</p>

    <p>As I wandered through the electronic labyrinth, I chatted with vendors and bought a pair of cheap headphones. When I asked one woman how the economy was faring compared to 10 years ago, she laughed. ‚ÄúChina has been developing continuously and will continue to grow!‚Äù I asked about Trump, and she waved the question off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in American politics. I just do business!‚Äù</p>

    <p>Another vendor kindly offered to help me apply to <a href="https://jawlipops.tumblr.com/post/701387507648151552/from-the-chinese-dating-game-show-%E9%9D%9E%E8%AF%9A%E5%8B%BF%E6%89%B0-fei-cheng" target="_blank">Feicheng Wurao</a> <em>[If You Are the One]</em>, which is by far my favorite dating show. Essentially, a man presents his life story to 30 women who ask questions and buzz out whenever they become unimpressed, often triggered by details like salary, hobbies, or dating history. When I was in 6th grade, I once sent in an application to ABC‚Äôs <em>The Bachelor</em>, written from the perspective of my golden retriever, Sally: ‚ÄúLong blonde hair. Affectionately described by friends as ‚Äòa bitch.‚Äô Strangers can‚Äôt seem to keep their hands off of me.‚Äù</p>

    <p>At Tencent‚Äôs headquarters, AI researchers discussed the impact of US export controls on domestic chip manufacturing.</p>

    <p>At a driver training hub for Huolala, I was struck by Party posters celebrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Bombs,_One_Satellite" target="_blank">‰∏§Âºπ‰∏ÄÊòü</a> (China‚Äôs first nuclear launch program). Even as a private company, Huolala encourages its drivers to view themselves as part of a broader social mission. During the pandemic, for instance, the company played a crucial part in distributing PPE and hand sanitizer.</p>

    <p>We also visited OPPO, a smartphone manufacturing company which holds around 15% of the domestic market. At the company‚Äôs exercise facilities, I airballed a 3-pointer, badly, and unfortunately, two dozen security cameras and 30 or so employees captured the moment on their phones, imprinting my failure into the digital annals of corporate surveillance forever. There go my dreams of playing for the Guangdong Southern Tigers.</p>

    <p>In Guangzhou, we visited a clothing sweatshop, where workers earned around $1,000 a month, much more than I was expecting. It‚Äôs worth noting that wages have risen dramatically in China since the beginning of economic reforms. We also toured Xiaopeng‚Äôs highly automated EV plant and Yihang, a startup developing autonomous passenger drones. One ‚Äúnon-military‚Äù drone designed for firefighting included a convenient mount to attach a turret! For ‚Ä¶ uh ‚Ä¶ extinguishing things.</p>

    <p>From Guangzhou, we flew to Yiwu aboard a COMAC C919, a Chinese domestically-built regional passenger jet. A flight attendant kindly closed the window shades as we began to descend, maybe to help us sleep, maybe because the airport doubles as a civilian-military facility. We were told not to take photos.</p>

    <p>Yiwu boasts no glitzy skylines, no imperial ruins, and honestly, no good dumpling spots (though there‚Äôs a weirdly good club scene). But in global trade terms, it might be one of the most important cities in the world.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img alt="yiwu2" loading="lazy" src="/images/yiwu2.jpeg"/>
    </div>

    <p>Home to the world‚Äôs largest wholesale market for small commodities, Yiwu is where the planet shops for costume jewelry, fake watches, phone cases, and toys. The International Trade City houses over 75,000 booths arranged by item category, each operated by someone who knows exactly how many military-grade laser pointers will fit in a 40-foot shipping container, and the cost per unit if you want to buy 10,000.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img alt="yiwu3" loading="lazy" src="/images/yiwu3.jpeg"/>
    </div>

    <p>Yiwu‚Äôs rise began in the early 1980s when local officials, defying central restrictions on private commerce, built permanent market stalls over a drainage ditch. Today, thousands of traders from around the world do business here, and the city is covered in signage in Russian, Persian, and Arabic. As we left the market, a video proudly proclaimed that Xi Jinping has, to date, mentioned the city 10 times in domestic and international news.</p>
