        <p>Hello all! I'm still alive.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, I visited the Ascension Cathedral, one of the tallest churches in the world constructed entirely out of wood (and supposedly without nails).</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
          <img alt="Inside the Ascension Cathedral" loading="lazy" src="/api/placeholder/800/400" />
        </div>
        
        <p>Inside, I chatted with Chinese tourists, and we took a group photo. They showed me pictures of their hometown in Xinjiang, whose natural landscape closely resembled Kazakhstan's. Trade with Xinjiang now accounts for 40% of all Kazakh-China trade, and bilateral migration and infrastructure investment have expanded dramatically in recent years. I'm curious what Kazakh citizens think of these developments.</p>
        
        <p>Next I went to the Arasan bathhouse, a massive, modernist complex built in 1982 at the behest of Dinmukhamed Kunayev. I visited during off-peak hours (around 12:30 pm), where the average age among patrons was around 60, and the average articles of clothing worn was around 0.2.</p>

        <p>The –±–∞–Ω—è (bath house) is one of my favorite Russian institutions. Bathers alternate between multiple steam rooms and cold plunges as a form of contrast hydrotherapy. Most people wear felt hats to protect their heads from the extreme heat. You also are supposed to smack yourself and each other with –≤–µ–Ω–∏–∫–∏, bundles of leaves (traditionally birch), for medicinal/sado-masochistic purposes.</p>
        
        <p>Inside, people of all ages come together to exchange stories and jokes. Someone invited me out for a beer, and another man introduced himself as the Vice President of the China-Russia Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        
        <p>I think civil society in the US would benefit from having places like Arasan, especially given how few bowling leagues there are nowadays. With a massage, the whole thing cost me less than $7.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I also got lunch at a Kazakh restaurant with Aida, the director of the think tank I'm working at. Some highlights from the meal include: baursak (semi-sweet donuts), kuurdak (stewed liver with onions and potato), beshbarmak (egg noodles with boiled horse meat!), and chak-chak (deep fried unleavened dough, the national dish of Tatarstan).</p>

        <p>I rarely eat meat, but I wanted to see what traditional food from the region looks like. Horse meat (–∫–æ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞) tastes pretty much like beef but with a gamier texture.</p>
        
        <p>I'm excited to meet the rest of the team tomorrow. Jet lag has been brutal, so I'll get to bed pretty quickly. Until next time!</p>
