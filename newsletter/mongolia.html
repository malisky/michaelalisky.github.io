        <p><em>Sand, storms, and sandstorms</em></p>
        
        <p>Long-time readers, devoted seminarians, cherished financial supporters: I'm currently sitting in Incheon International Airport in South Korea, enjoying a snack from the CU convenience store. I shake my head, and soft, vermillion sand trickles out of my ears.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, the city of Ulaanbaatar (UB) declared an emergency weather warning due to extreme gusts of wind and high risks of roofs blowing away. Nevertheless, our flight made it out of Mongolia this morning. I'm exhausted but sad to go. Next stop: Taiwan.</p>

        <p>Using a compass and intermittent bouts of cell service, we eventually found our Way. The melancholic discography of Lana del Rey, recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1jik87s/fake_news_lana_featured_in_billboard_mongolia/" target="_blank">named</a> Mongolia's 2025 Woman of the Year, and Choi's phone announcing sporadic Facetime calls from "Cat Face with Heart-Shaped Eyes" were the only interruptions to our tense, nervous silence. Boggie, the guide Julia found on Facebook, also occasionally proffered mandarin oranges.</p>

        <p>As we neared the Khongoryn Els "singing" sand dunes, a pair of headlights cut across the darkness. A white Prius, packed with ten or eleven people, answered our prayers. Because we were so late, the entire family whose <i>ger</i> we were staying in had come looking.</p>
        
        <p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurt" target="_blank">Gers</a></i>, also known as yurts in Turkic languages, evolved to suit nomadic pastoralism and transhumance from winter to summer pastures and back. These movable homes have been used continuously by nomads in Central and Inner Asia for thousands of years. Several generations live together under one roof.</p>

        <p>Flocks of sheep spilled over the dusty hills and scattered like the mist, and we rode ponies across the Mongolian steppe. Pujee, who fetched the semi-domesticated animals from across the hill on his dirtbike, told us he enjoys eating horse testicles (when presented the opportunity). He offered a few otherwise really profound bits of wisdom.</p>
