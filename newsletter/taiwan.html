         Greetings, gusto, and good tidings! (US trade policy notwithstanding). I'm finally back on campus and have awoken from a nice nap on the couch. I feel like my dad (but with way less swag).

         After the unrelenting inclemencies of the Mongolian steppe, I was grateful to have a few days in Taiwan to just chill. Highlights include: seeing friends, eating delicious vegetarian food, bathing in the Beitou hot springs, nodding my head pretentiously during an oolong tea tasting, belting out Deng Lijun at karaoke, galavanting through night markets, and wandering through rainy streets at night.

         I even got to see Hannah, which was epic. We met while studying Chinese in Beijing two summers ago, and she's currently in Taiwan teaching English and saving democracy on a Fullbright scholarship.

         I'm so grateful to be able to do crossover episodes with friends from different parts of my life.

         My only major disappointment was that the famous Jadeite Cabbage was not on display at the Palace Museum (maybe somebody mistakenly ate it?). The museum is full of treasure and artifacts taken from the Forbidden City in Beijing after the Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949. I did like this little guy though.

         Nastya, Josie, and I also saw koalas, cool birds, and (ironically) Przewalski's horses at the Taipei zoo. I restrained myself/was restrained from hugging the sloths.

         Finally, Rahul and I met Daniel and Struan, two European graduate students at NCCU, in the onsen. Long-time readers will recall my love of hot springs, banyas, and other clothing-free male ablutionary social spaces. We checked out Ningxia, discussed civil society civilly, and had a banter-filled night (they were impressed with my knowledge of British slang). Rahul had the profound reflection that it's usually more common to take one's clothes off
         <i>
          after
         </i>
         grabbing a drink.

         Cheers to another fun trip. I'm excited to be back on campus where I can read my silly books, go to class, and sit
         <s>
          my white ass down
         </s>
         and listen üó£‚úç.

         Until next time.
