        <p><em>A cat named Yusuf.</em></p>
        
        <p>Yesterday on the way to Istanbul Airport, I asked my taxi driver if we could stop for ice cream. He thought about it, said "one minute," and then offered me a cigarette. I declined and took a nap as we inched our way through the traffic.</p>
        
        <p>Part of the reason I was so tired is because when I returned to my hotel room late the night before, there was a cat sitting on my bed. He was friendly enough, and very polite, but I have no idea how he got in.</p>
        
        <div class="image-grid">
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="Yusuf the cat on bed" src="/images/yusuf1.jpeg"/>

            <img alt="Yusuf the cat close-up" src="/images/yusuf2.jpeg"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Yusuf (I decided to call him Yusuf) woke me up a few times during the night, nibbling at my feet or otherwise entreating cuddles. When a nearby mosque announced the morning call to prayer, he meowed to be let out but came back a few hours later to say goodbye as I packed up my room.</p>
        
        <p>Not including Yusuf, Istanbul has over 125,000 stray cats, and they're all remarkably affectionate and clean. Cats are considered ritually pure within Islam, but Istanbul in particular <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-37880274" target="_blank">benefited</a> from their presence during Ottoman times, when traditional wood houses and a warm climate facilitated the spread of disease-infested mice and rats.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>I met many great cats, and also one asshole cat which deserves special attention for stealing food right off my plate.</p>

        <p>With all the important stuff out of the way, I also wanted to write a bit about Istanbul's unique cultural heritage, history, and architecture.</p>
        
        <p>In 482, a man named Petrus Sabbatius was born near modern Skopje, North Macedonia. The son of a pig farmer, by 527, he would eventually <a href="https://www.britannica.com/question/How-did-Justinian-I-become-emperor" target="_blank">become</a> emperor. There's far too much to say about Justinian I in this one email, but I bring him up because his mark on old Constantinople was indelible. Under his rule, the Byzantine empire built the Hagia Sophia and Basilica Cistern, reconquered former territories, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Justinian" target="_blank">codified</a> Roman law. In 532 Justinian declared an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Peace_(532)" target="_blank">era</a> of perpetual peace with the Sasanian empire (which lasted 8 years). He even managed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling_of_silkworm_eggs_into_the_Roman_Empire" target="_blank">smuggle</a> in silkworm eggs from China to establish a domestic Roman silk industry.</p>
        
        <div class="image-grid">
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="Basilica Cistern" src="/images/cistern.jpeg"/>
          </div>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="Medusa column base in cistern" src="/images/cistern-medusa.jpeg"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Hagia Sophia was of course the main showstopper. Because the Ottoman rulers removed the church's Christian ornamentation, the central dome almost felt more grand in its emptiness.</p>
        
        <div class="image-grid">
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="Exterior of Hagia Sophia" src="/images/hagia-sofia-outside.jpeg"/>
          </div>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img alt="Interior of Hagia Sophia dome" src="/images/hagia-sofia-inside.jpeg"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Speaking of, I lost track of time while reading on the subway and found myself on the edge of the old Constantinople walls. I walked along them for a few hours, stopping to play soccer, feed pigeons (gÃ¼vercin), and try boda, a mildly alcoholic drink made of fermented chickpeas.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
          <img alt="Boda drink made from chickpeas" src="/images/boda.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>I eventually reached the <a href="https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/gate-of-st-romanus-23609.html" target="_blank">Gate of Saint Romanus</a>, where, in 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror besieged Constantinople, transforming the city to Ottoman rule, and with it, turning the Hagia Sophia into a mosque.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
          <img alt="Walls of Constantinople near the gate" src="/images/ottoman-wall.jpeg"/>

        <p>These are the Aqueduct of Valens, built in 368, seamlessly incorporating a modern highway underneath.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
          <img alt="Aqueduct of Valens with road beneath" src="/images/aqueduct.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>That's enough of that for now, but DM me if you want more pictures or facts related to Istanbul's Roman history. I think about it almost daily.</p>
        
        <p>The next day, I explored the Archaeology Museum with Enes and Meva, and afterwards, felt inspired by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/literature/nazim/walnuttree.html" target="_blank">this poem</a> to climb a walnut tree in Gulhane park.</p>

        <p>Across the Bosphorus in KadÄ±kÃ¶y, Miray was shocked to hear I had never had authentic Turkish baklava, and she ordered 8 different kinds for me to try. It was way too much, but as she admonished, "no Ã§Ã¶p," i.e, no leftovers.</p>
        
        <p>I also tried Tavuk GÃ¶ÄŸÃ¼sÃ¼, a sort of milk pudding made with shredded chicken breast (not my favorite, but the macros are insane). The texture was eerily similar to some unfortunate pancakes Nicole and I made last week.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Other highlights include sneaking into a Chinese tour group at Topkapi palace and trying some life-changing white bean stew (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mUEETTXim3cFKtgZ9" target="_blank">Kuru Fasulye</a>) near the Pera Art Museum.</p>

        <p>If you've survived my bloviating this long, well done, and thank you. It means a lot to hear that you're reading and enjoying what I'm writing.</p>
        
        <p>My only extraneous advice is to remember that the royal palace where AtatÃ¼rk died is called DolmabahÃ§e, not DomalbahÃ§e, which is an important linguistic distinction.</p>

        <p>Huge thanks to Irmak and Fiona for all your recommendations. I'm sad to leave Istanbul, but I'm looking forward to spending some time in Vienna catching up with classes and friends.</p>
        
        <p>Until next time,<br/>Michael</p>
