        <p>On Sunday, I graduated with my masterâ€™s degree, bade a tearful goodbye to my friends, dropped my parents off at the airport, packed up my room, and rushed to catch a midnight flight to Hong Kong.</p>

        <div class="image-container"><img loading="lazy" src="/images/14F4A43B-4702-4F08-BDF2-C5F8B3C2736A_1_102_o.jpeg"/></div>

        <p>Iâ€™m currently on a bus to Shenzhen, and the primary emotion Iâ€™m feeling right now is eepy. But Iâ€™m also overflowing with gratitude and excitement for whatâ€™s to come. The last five or six years at Stanford are hard to describe, let alone understand, but I feel like Iâ€™m heading into the world with a kind of momentum and optimism that have, at times, eluded me. I know things that freshman me wanted to know, and far more things have come to me that I was not wise enough to even know I wanted to know.</p>

        <p>As I finally leave, things feel kind of right, and I'm ready to go. Iâ€™m more focused, appreciative, and sure of myself than Iâ€™ve ever been before. Part of that comes from the adventure ahead, but mostly it comes from the support and love of my friends and family. Iâ€™m sure the sadness of leaving will hit soon, but for now, I feel happy.</p>

        <p>Over the last few years, Iâ€™ve faced challenges and heartbreaks, disappointments and consternations. But Iâ€™ve also begun to learn how to use these moments of groundlessness (<a href="https://billmoyers.com/content/pema-chadron/" target="_blank">source</a>), when it feels like the rug has been pulled out from beneath me, as opportunities to reassess and replant my feet with greater conviction. I can choose where I land and move forward on new terms.</p>

        <p>At Stanford, Iâ€™ve found people who see me clearly. Iâ€™ve developed my voice and pursued my curiosities. Iâ€™ve traveled the world and read (a lot), and Iâ€™ve learned from some of the best. I've had a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>In other news, which will surprise perhaps no one, Iâ€™ll be in China, mostly in Beijing, until December. Iâ€™m slowly warming to the idea of maybe applying for a job at some point. I also hope to get better at salsa dancing.</p>

        <p>To that end, dearest readers, please do let me know if youâ€™ll be in town, or if youâ€™d like to send me devotions or remunerative gifts, or if you have reading recommendations. I can forward you my shipping address and SWIFT info.</p>

        <p>My time in China begins with a research trip alongside my academic advisor, Scott Rozelle, and two dozen Stanford students, including Celo and Rahul. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>

        <p>Today started at 5 a.m. when we landed in Hong Kong. After a quick hotel breakfast and a shower, we headed to Hong Kong University, a brick-lined urban rainforest whose compactness belied its proprioceptive height, perched a few hundred meters in the air and revealed now and then by sweeping glimpses of the harbor.</p>

        </div>

        <p>We had lunch with the cityâ€™s Minister of Treasury, who rattled off Hong Kongâ€™s rankings in global financial competitiveness, tax simplicity, and regulatory openness, displaying considerable stamina and lung capacity during his rhodomontade on the city he clearly adores.</p>

        <p>Eugene, a local community college lecturer who moonlights as a tour guide, narrated the cityâ€™s development as we drove through the rain-dappled streets. The clouds hung low, sprinkling intermittently, just enough to remind us of their presence.</p>

        <p>In a mall bookstore, I read the first chapter of McCarthyâ€™s <em>Blood Meridian</em> before Celo and I set off in search of street food. We settled for sandwiches from 7/11 and hurried back to the bus.</p>

        <p>I hope to have more time in the coming weeks to reflect on what it means to leave Stanford, but one thing that needs no distillation is the gratitude I feel for the friends whoâ€™ve been a part of this journey, those whom I was able to find photos of, and otherwise. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I also decided to upload my past newsletters to a personal website, which you can now view at <a href="https://www.michaelalisky.com" target="_blank">www.michaelalisky.com</a>. If you find any bugs or client-side errors, keep them to yourself.</p>
