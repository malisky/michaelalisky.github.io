        <p><em>Guten Morgen, Partymenschen!</em></p>
        
        <p>I'm currently on a train back to Vienna from Budapest, contemplating many life decisions. Here are some stats from the weekend:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>64,938 steps</li>
          <li>5 total hours of sleep</li>
          <li>2 words of Hungarian: Eg√©szs√©g√©re (cheers) and igen (yes)</li>
          <li>1 Australian dance sequence</li>
          <li>0 thermal bath chess games (I really tried to make this happen though)</li>
          <li>and countless missing brain cells</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I stayed in a hostel for the first time, which is just like a hotel, except it's way cheaper and also some drunk guy enters your room at 5am singing in Italian. We did get little treasure chests to store our belongings though, which I think complemented the overall experience.</p>
        
        <p>One weekend in Budapest is enough <a href="https://dungeonsanddragonsfifthedition.tumblr.com/post/646566484644085760" target="_blank">paprika</a> for a lifetime. On Saturday, I met up with Rachel and Zai, two American friends from the DA, for a succulent meal of paprika catfish soup and a side of paprika potatoes. We finished by snorting lines of paprika directly off the table (mom, this is a joke).</p>

        <p>"The spice" is indigenous to Central Mexico and only arrived in Hungary through the Balkans (then under Ottoman control) in the 16th century. But it wasn't until the 19th century that paprika became a defining feature of Hungarian cuisine and culture, and not until the Soviet occupation that agricultural production really took off. In 1937, Hungarian scientist Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi won a Nobel prize for isolating Vitamin C ‚Äî which he did using paprika peppers.</p>
        
        <p>On Sunday, Rachel, Zai, and I woke up far too early to go on a free walking tour of the city. The Danube river, grandiose buildings (the parliament and cathedral are both exactly 96m tall to commemorate the year Hungary was founded, 896), a random Ronald Reagan statue: this city's got it all.</p>

        <p>On the Buda side of Budapest, we tried L√°ngos, a deep fried flatbread topped with garlic, sour cream, and cheese (this was a hit, but I couldn't help but think: has Hungary out-America'ed America?).</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>At St. Stephen's cathedral, we found the mummified "holy right hand" of Hungary's first king, Stephen I, and also the tomb of Ferenc Pusk√°s, a legendary Hungarian footballer who led the Mighty Magyars to a 6-3 victory over England in 1953 (no severed body parts, as far as I could tell).</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>On the tour, we also befriended two Aussie solo-travelers named Paris and Jovan and spent the day sightseeing together, as well as the night, which began with dinner at a funky industrial style restaurant called Kiosk and finished at a 7-in-1 party death star called Instant-Fogas. Of course, no night out is complete without a pit stop at a karaoke bar.</p>

        <p>This weekend was a lovely, spontaneous, sleep-deprived adventure, and I can't wait to explore more of Europe and meet more wonderful people.</p>
        
        <p>Some other recent highlights include a d√∂ner at <a href="https://g.co/kgs/TVrRRyK" target="_blank">Ferhat</a> and dessert at <a href="https://www.vollpension.wien/en/welcome/" target="_blank">Vollpension</a>. Vollpension is a coffee house in Vienna that employs sweet old ladies as the bakers and servers. It functions both as a pension supplement and a means of maintaining social interactions for the elderly.10/10, no notes.</p>
        
        <p>To paraphrase a <a href="https://vladey.net/ru/artwork/4641" target="_blank">Russian saying</a>, life is good, and to live is also good! I've found a good rhythm with my studies (by the way, students knock on the table rather than clap after lectures here) and have relished exploring places like the Museum for Applied Art and going for walks in between classes.</p>

        <p>Next week, I'm "chucking a sickie" and heading to Istanbul for a long weekend. Until then I'll be hibernating.</p>
