        <p><em>Guten Abend, Partymenschen!</em></p>
        <p>I'm currently on a train back to Vienna from Budapest, contemplating many life decisions. Here are some representative stats from the weekend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>64,938 steps</li>
          <li>5 total hours of sleep</li>
          <li>2 words of Hungarian: Egészségére (cheers) and igen (yes) and 1 Australian dance sequence learned</li>
          <li>0 thermal bath chess games (I really tried to make this happen though)</li>
          <li>and countless missing brain cells</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I stayed in a hostel for the first time, which is just like a hotel, except it's way cheaper and also some drunk guy enters your room at 5am singing in Italian. We did get little treasure chests to store our belongings though, which I think complemented the overall experience.</p>
        <p>One weekend in Budapest is enough <a href="https://dungeonsanddragonsfifthedition.tumblr.com/post/646566484644085760" target="_blank">paprika</a> for a lifetime. On Saturday, I met up with Rachel and Zai, two American friends from the DA, for a succulent meal of paprika catfish soup and a side of paprika potatoes. We finished by snorting lines of paprika directly off the table (this is a joke, mom).</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The spice&rdquo; is indigenous to Central Mexico and only arrived in Hungary in the 16th century through the Balkans (then under Ottoman control). But it wasn't until the 19th century that paprika became a defining feature of Hungarian cuisine and culture, and not until the Soviet occupation that agricultural production really took off. Hungarian scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Szent-Györgyi" target="_blank">Albert Szent-Györgyi</a> even used paprika peppers to isolate the chemical structure of Vitamin C, garnering him the 1937 Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology.</p>

        <p>On the Buda side of Budapest, we tried Lángos, a deep fried flatbread topped with garlic, sour cream, and cheese (this was a hit).</p>

        <p>At St. Stephen's cathedral, we found the mummified "holy right hand" of Hungary's first king, Stephen I, and also the tomb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Puskás" target="_blank">Ferenc Puskás</a>, a legendary Hungarian footballer who led the Mighty Magyars to a 6-3 victory over England in 1953 (his memorial featured no severed body parts, as far as I could tell).</p>

        <p>On the tour, we also befriended two Aussie solo-travelers named Paris and Jovan and spent the day sightseeing together, as well as the night, which began with dinner at a funky industrial style restaurant called <a href="https://www.kiosk-budapest.hu/en/" target="_blank">Kiosk</a> that my friend Betty recommended, and we finished at a 7-in-1 party death star called <a href="https://instant-fogas.com/" target="_blank">Instant-Fogas</a>. Of course, no night out is complete without a pit stop at a karaoke bar.</p>

        <p>This weekend was a lovely, spontaneous, sleep-deprived adventure, and I can't wait to explore more of Europe and meet more wonderful people.</p>

        <p>Some other recent highlights include a döner with Immo at Ferhat and dessert at Vollpension with Kate and Zai. Vollpension is a coffee house in Vienna that employs sweet old ladies as the bakers and servers. It functions both as a pension supplement and a means of maintaining social interactions for the elderly.10/10, no notes.</p>

        <p>To paraphrase a <a href="https://vladey.net/ru/artwork/4641" target="_blank">Russian saying</a>, life is good, and to live is also good! I've found a rhythm with my studies (by the way, students knock on the table rather than clapping after lectures here) and I've relished exploring places like the Museum for Applied Art and going for walks in between classes.</p>

        <p>Next week, I'm "<a href="https://www.pearsonpte.com/articles/12-aussie-slang-words-you-need-to-know#:~:text=Chucking%20a%20sickie,that%20%E2%80%9C%E2%80%93ie%E2%80%9D%20again." target="_blank">chucking a sickie</a>" and heading to Istanbul for a long weekend. Until then I'll be hibernating.</p>
