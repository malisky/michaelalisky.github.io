        <p>Devoted readers and dearest seminarians; cherished friends and respected foes: I hope you will forgive me for the long delay in our correspondence!</p>
        
        <p>Amidst a dazed stupor, "In the middle of the journey of our life, I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost," and I realized it has been three weeks since my last email. HÃ©las!</p>
        
        <p>On November 5, during a boisterous election night watch party, my friends and I stayed up late phone banking, as cheers erupted from the MAGA Europeans every time Trump won another battleground state.</p>

        <p>Soon thereafter, I made syrniki for Astrid's cat, Moritz, before taking the train to Brno, Czechia, in search of two noteworthy attractions: the "Brno dragon," hanging in the City Hall, and a suppository-shaped, marble-dispensing astronomical clock located in the town's main square (spoiler: neither were hard to find).</p>

        <p>To be fair, if I were a 16th century Czech townsman, I would probably also think this crocodile was a dragon.</p>

        <p>At the Vienna Staatsoper, we saw a ballet rendition of <em>The Winter's Tale</em> by Shakespeare, and I then exited to Bratislava, pursued by a bear, for a night of contemporary music and wine from San Marino.</p>

        <p>More specifically, the Embassy of the Republic of San Marino hosted a concert in Slovakia in celebration of the 60th birthday of Massimiliano Messieri, "one of the major figures, if not THE major figure, of San Marino contemporary music panorama," and you know I had to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuavuPxN4Xc" target="_blank">pull up</a> ðŸ”¥ I did fall asleep twice during the concert, but the after party was pretty lit.</p>
