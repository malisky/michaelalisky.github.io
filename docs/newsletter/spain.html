        <p>Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a Joyful Kwanzaa to all!!</p>
        
        <p>I'm finally back home, and after a brief hibernation, I wanted to send one final newsletter to cap off my time abroad.</p>
        
        <p>I spent the last week gallivanting through Andalucía, with each dinner starting later and ending more tipsy than the last. In Granada, I met up with my dear friend Abi to visit the Alhambra palace, where we observed all 17 mathematically possible <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/circle/documents/2021/Ganapathy.pdf" target="_blank">wallpaper groups</a> (unique ways to tile a 2D plane) and learned how medieval hydraulics work. The Alhambra was first built between 1238 and 1358 during the Naṣrid Emirate of Granada's golden age but was nearly lost to ruin until restoration in the 1800s.</p>

        <p>At night, we bar-hopped through winding alleys, receiving a complimentary tapita (small appetizer) with each drink — I don<q>t know what it would take to bring this practice to the US, but if you</q>re reading this and are capable of doing something, please do.</p>

        <p> I satisfied my yearning for the subaltern in the Sacromonte neighborhood, where whitewashed caves carved into the hillside in the 16th century provided religious and ethnic sanctuary for marginalized groups. Many remained inhabited well into the 20th century. I think I might have seen an amateur Bitcoin mining operation underway in one of them.</p>

        <p>In Sevilla, I met up with Alonso, one of Marcelo's friends from Lima, and we ate a <q>pecha</q> (Andaluz for a <q>shit-ton</q>) before catching a Flamenco show at a local <a href="https://g.co/kgs/vPZTa7j" target="_blank">tablao</a>.</p>

        <p>Alonso also took me to a Semana-Santa-themed <a href="https://g.co/kgs/ZSdZ1Jh" target="_blank">bar</a>, an incense-filled Catholic fever dream where the house drink (as far as I could tell, the only cocktail available) is called <q>the Blood of Christ,</q> a crimson concoction of grenadine, sparkling wine, and gin. Someone who knows more about Catholicism will have to comment on how sacrilegious this is.</p>

        <p>On the subject of blasphemy, I added a new entry to the historic canon of cantankerous, eccentric Petes: Peter the Great, my little brother, and now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_of_Castile" target="_blank">Pedro I of Sevilla</a>. A Christian king, Pedro commissioned his palace, the Alcázar, to replicate the Alhambra. Elaborate Arabic inscriptions still proclaim <q>Glory to the Sultan Don Pedro,</q> and I couldn't find a single cross inside the complex (although there was a Star of David). Pedro, evidently, beefed with the Church and met his untimely end at the hands of his half brother in 1369.</p>

        <p>Along with King Pedro, Christopher Columbus is also buried inside the Seville Cathedral.</p>

        <p> A short train ride away in Cádiz, I climbed the Cathedral tower, where I met an older German gentleman who informed me he was on a search for ancient ruins. We talked entirely in German, so I really didn’t understand much, but at one point, he tapped his chest and said, “I have Roman blood in my heart.” I wonder how many times he thinks about the Roman empire each week.</p>

        <p>In ancient times, Cádiz (then known as Gades) was considered to be located at the edge of the known world. The Latin phrase <q>non plus ultra</q> (nothing further beyond) is <a href="https://www.ciee.org/go-abroad/high-school-study-abroad/summer/blog/non-plus-ultra-cadiz" target="_blank">associated</a> with the city. They've got great seafood too.</p>

        <p>Back in Seville, I got a much-needed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1rpbGpSO71N95aQOTw67xk?si=0167c141ec354b5a" target="_blank">haircut</a> and fed some ducks. At night, we hung out at the Alameda de Hércules and grabbed dinner at my friend<q>s friend</q>s girlfriend<q>s aunt</q>s <a href="https://g.co/kgs/sbYKxqp" target="_blank">restaurant</a> (buss).</p>

        <p>I had a wonderful time in Spain, and it was a great way to cap off an awesome adventure. I<q>ve grown during these last few months and learned a lot, and I</q>m grateful for this extended opportunity. But man did I miss home!</p>
