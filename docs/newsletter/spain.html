        <p><em>Tapas, drinks, and tapas.</em></p>
        
        <p>Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a Joyful Kwanzaa to all!!</p>
        
        <p>I'm finally back home, but I wanted to send one final newsletter to cap off my time abroad.</p>
        
        <p>I spent the last week gallivanting through Andalucía, with each dinner starting later and ending more tipsy than the last. In Granada, I met up with my dear friend Abi to visit the Alhambra palace, where we observed all 17 mathematically possible <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/circle/documents/2021/Ganapathy.pdf" target="_blank">wallpaper groups</a> (unique ways to tile a 2D plane) and learned how medieval hydraulics work. The Alhambra was first built between 1238 and 1358 during the Naṣrid Emirate of Granada's golden age but was nearly lost to ruin until restoration in the 1800s.</p>
        
        <p>At night, we bar-hopped through winding alleys, receiving a complimentary tapita (small appetizer) with each drink — I don't know what it would take to bring this practice to the US, but if you're reading this and are capable of doing something, please do.</p>
        
        <p>In Sevilla, I met up with Alonso, one of Marcelo's friends from Lima, and his girlfriend, Maria. We ate a "pecha" (Andaluz for a "shit-ton") and caught a Flamenco show at a local <a href="https://g.co/kgs/vPZTa7j" target="_blank">tablao</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Alonso also took me to a Semana-Santa-themed <a href="https://g.co/kgs/ZSdZ1Jh" target="_blank">bar</a>, an incense-filled Catholic fever dream where the house drink (as far as I could tell, the only cocktail available) is called "the Blood of Christ," a concoction of grenadine, sparkling wine, and gin. Someone who knows more about Catholicism will have to comment on how sacrilegious this is.</p>
        
        <p>On the subject of blasphemy, I added a new entry to the historic canon of cantankerous, eccentric Petes: Peter the Great, my little brother, and now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_of_Castile" target="_blank">Pedro I of Sevilla</a>. A Christian king, Pedro commissioned his palace, the Alcázar, to replicate the Alhambra. Elaborate Arabic inscriptions still proclaim "Glory to the Sultan Don Pedro," and I couldn't find a single cross inside the complex (although there was a Star of David). Pedro beefed with the Church and met his untimely end at the hands of his half brother in 1369.</p>
        
        <p>In ancient times, Cádiz (then known as Gades) was considered to be located at the edge of the known world. The phrase "non plus ultra" (nothing further beyond) is <a href="https://www.ciee.org/go-abroad/high-school-study-abroad/summer/blog/non-plus-ultra-cadiz" target="_blank">associated</a> with the city. They've got great seafood too.</p>
        
        <p>Back in Seville, I got a much-needed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1rpbGpSO71N95aQOTw67xk?si=0167c141ec354b5a" target="_blank">haircut</a> and fed some ducks. At night, we hung out at the Alameda de Hércules and grabbed dinner at my friend's friend's girlfriend's aunt's <a href="https://g.co/kgs/sbYKxqp" target="_blank">restaurant</a> (buss).</p>
        
        <p>I had a wonderful time in Spain, and it was a great way to cap off an awesome adventure. I've grown during these last few months and learned a lot, and I'm grateful for this extended opportunity. But man did I miss home!</p>
        
        <p><s>As for these newsletters, that's a wrap!</s> To my friends who read these updates, thank you so much. Your engagement, thoughtful responses, and generous financial contributions have made all the difference.</p>
        
        <p>Until next time,<br/>Michael</p>
