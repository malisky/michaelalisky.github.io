          <p>Greetings and good tidings from Turpan! I've been feeling awfully <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1978/01/26/illness-as-metaphor/" target="_blank">tubercular</a> lately,
             like a meek Victorian child stuck in a Gothic sanatorium. To clarify, I briefly fell ill with a minor cold but have since recovered. On the bright side, I think fleeting discomforts like these can help
              men better empathize with the pains and travails of childbirth. At any rate, with my phlegm expectorated and spirits lifted, I humbly present my latest dispatch:</p>
      
          <p>While off-roading in the Kumtag Desert, predictably, I became violently carsick. Things started off fine but escalated quickly when I asked our driver to turn the music up.
             We soon found ourselves in a scene straight out of Mad Max, EDM pounding and sand geysering as we launched over successive dunes with increasing abandon. Celo shouted, <q>Witness me!</q>
              and my stomach swapped places with my liver.</p>

          </div>
      
          <p>Hours later, as I battled nausea at a Shanshan county rest stop, a 30-car police brigade suddenly thundered by.
             It was July 5th, the 16th anniversary of the 2009 Urumqi riots, and the state was here to remind everyone of its clout.
              45 minutes later, Abu, our driver, received a call instructing us to pull over. Three Uyghur police officers
               inspected our phones, even checking the recently deleted folder, to make sure we hadn't taken any photos or videos.
                Thankfully, they overlooked my album entitled <q>Idiotic but political memes,</q> and with the crisis averted, we were soon on our way.</p>

          <p>Turpan, one of China's hottest and lowest regions, brims with archaeological wonders, from ancient cities swallowed by sand to lush vineyards defying the arid climate.
             Pilgrims often travel here to bury their legs in scorching sands, believing the convalescence can heal rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and <em>ligma</em>.</p>

          <p>Outside the city, we found the ruins of a centuries-old Christian church, built before Islam had made it to Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>Celo, Fiona, Dhruv, and I ventured through the famed Karez canals, one of China's three ancient engineering marvels, constructed over 1,000 years ago to channel mountain snowmelt into agricultural fields.
            I met a garrulous Kazakh gentleman whose views on contemporary race relations, like the subterranean water, were largely unfiltered.</p>

          <p>At <a href="https://www.advantour.com/china/turpan/jiaohe.htm" target="_blank">Jiaohe</a>, a 2,300-year-old earthen settlement and former capital of the Cheshi kingdom,
            I convinced Dhruv to try cold green bean juice, which he did not like, and we also saw some geese following around a duck.</p>

          <p>At a lively local bazaar, Fiona held a Peking duck while Celo munched on lamb skewers, and Dhruv was soon invited to dance.</p>

          <p>The nearby Tuyuk (Tuyugou) village, named for an old Yemeni phrase meaning <q>lost the rope,</q> truly felt like a point of no return as temperatures soared beyond 40°C.
            My favorite part was the Wild Pigeon Home, constructed by a Qing Dynasty carpenter skilled in mimicking pigeon calls. I really love pigeons, so I was
            happy to overhear a young tour guide explain to some other tourists that pigeons are not only <q>auspicious birds</q> (吉祥鸟), but they also symbolize <q>freedom and peace</q>
             and exemplify the harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. Right on.</p>

          <p>This is our guide Tahir, whom I hired after exchanging a few lapidary Xiaohongshu DMs, and also a photo of me holding a melon.

            Tahir was an exceptional guide: knowledgeable, kind, and sincere. He briefly studied English in Xi'an after middle school
             but had to return home early amid village gossip that he had run away from his wife and middle school sweetheart, Gulmarzhan. After showing us around Turpan
             and Grape Valley for three days, Tahir graciously invited us over to his home for dinner.</p>

          <p>His wife prepared homemade Laghman noodles and served rose-petal tea with fresh jujubes,
             one of the best beverages I've ever tasted (and a nice change from the aforementioned green bean juice).</p>

          <p>At the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves, I developed an intense dislike for Albert von Le Coq, the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_von_Le_Coq" target="_blank">wine-merchant-turned-amateur-archaeologist</a> responsible for vandalizing the ancient frescoes and stealing most of the local art.</p>

          <p>Finally, this is Wan Dou (豌豆), the resident golden retriever from our Turpan hostel, 
            and also a very cute baby from our uneventful flight to Ili (you can respond to this email with any name ideas).</p>
