        <p>For some reason, there are punching bag arcade machines randomly on the streets in Almaty. I probably saw four or five of them today. It‚Äôs a pretty funny business model, really targeting the ‚Äúwalking around looking for something to punch‚Äù crowd. Maybe it‚Äôs more of a first date kind of thing. I‚Äôm curious what you think. Realistically, it‚Äôs probably designed for drunk people. At 21¬¢ a whack, I can easily see this becoming my next vice.</p>

          Boxing is a big deal here, accounting for 24 of Kazakhstan‚Äôs 75 all-time Summer Olympic medals
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan_at_the_Olympics" target="_blank">(source)</a>, including 7 golds. The government spends
          <a href="https://inbusiness.kz/ru/news/kazahstan-tratit-na-razvitie-sporta-55-5-mlrd-tenge-ezhegodno" target="_blank">(source)</a> $372 million a year on combat sports, and some 30,000 amateur boxers actively compete
          <a href="https://gokazakhstan.net/posts/why-kazakhstan-boxers-are-knocking-everyone-out-at-the-olympics" target="_blank">(source)</a> throughout the country. In 2011, Kazakhstan invested heavily in the Olympic boxing federation in a deal that raised significant ethical concerns
          <a href="https://landofbooks.org/2017/10/18/the-dirty-socks-of-olympic-boxing-part-1-kazakhstan-government-invested-10-mil-into-aiba/" target="_blank">(source)</a> due to its lack of transparency. Must be all the potassium.

        <p>On an unrelated note, I had a big doner kebab yesterday (it looks normal sized in the photo, but that‚Äôs just because I have been going to the gym recently).</p>

        <p>Here‚Äôs another angle for reference, featuring new friends, Tlegen and Akezhan. The drink is ayran, a mix of yogurt, salt, and water.</p>
        <p>I also went to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7Qk6v8Qk6v8Qk6v8A" target="_blank">Zhetysu-Semirech'ye</a> (–ñ–µ—Ç—ã—Å—É-–°–µ–º–∏—Ä–µ—á—å–µ) bazaar on the outskirts of Almaty. People sold all sorts of trinkets and antiques, and there was a strange amount of non-functioning computer equipment. I bought a 1970s Soviet pin and considered buying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobyz" target="_blank">kobyz</a> (traditional Kazakh instrument), but in the end decided against it.</p>

        <p>My taxi driver unfortunately rear-ended another car as we were leaving the bazaar, and an old apashka (–∞–ø–∞—à–∫–∞, the Kazakh version of babushka) stormed out of the driver‚Äôs seat. Thankfully, everyone was okay, and after a bit of arguing, the drivers exchanged cash and parted ways. I saw something very similar when visiting Marcelo in Lima, and I think it‚Äôs worth remembering that ‚Äúthe rule of law‚Äù can be very inefficient in comparison to informal dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>

        <p>Overall, my internship is going well, and I‚Äôm meeting all sorts of interesting people. In the meantime, there‚Äôs been no shortage of unexpectedly cool things at every corner. I hope everyone has a great weekend!</p>
