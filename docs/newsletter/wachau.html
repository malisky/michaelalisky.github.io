        <p>Christian girl autumn is officially here! And how better to celebrate than with a visit to Schönbrunn Palace, the Hapsburg's main summer residence? Unfortunately, about 14 separate Chinese tour groups had the exact same idea, and there was a 4-hour wait to get in. We decided to just walk around the gardens instead.</p>

        <p>The day before, October 26, was Austrian National Day, a holiday commemorating Austria's constitutional enshrinement of permanent neutrality in 1955. To celebrate, I woke up early to catch a train to the Wachau valley, a "sundrenched" and "enchanting" "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/apr/18/a-z-wagner-gesamtkunstwerk" target="_blank">gesamtkunstwerk</a> (total work of art) and gathering place for epicures from around the globe" (find someone who talks <a href="https://www.donau.com/en/the-danube-in-lower-austria/information-service/media-b2b/media/fine-dining-of-the-highest-caliber-best-of-wachau/" target="_blank">about you</a> like the Danube River tourism website writes about Wachau).</p>

        <p>Wachau was beautiful, spooky, and yes, enchanting. Starting in Krems, we hiked for almost eight hours through golden vineyards and rolling hills along the Danube, stopping at Dürnstein Castle just before sunset. In 1192, Richard the Lionheart was <a href="https://www.lower-austria.info/excursion-destinations/a-the-ruins-of-duernstein-castle" target="_blank">imprisoned</a> here after offending Leopold V of Austria during the Third Crusade. According to legend, his loyal minstrel Blondel discovered the king's location by singing beneath each castle in the realm until he heard Richard's voice joining in from within the fortress walls. A similar thing once happened to me while singing "No Flockin'" by Kodak Black in the stacks of Green Library.</p>

        <p>We barely made our train back to Vienna and eventually made it home around 11 PM… and promptly went salsa dancing. I was tired, but as Bad Bunny once remarked <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/71wFwRo8xGc4lrcyKwsvba?si=07c0a3e3805642bc" target="_blank">in a song</a>, "Siempre puest[o] pa' la misión" (always ready for the mission).</p>
        
        <p>Speaking of classical music, I had a lovely time at the Italian embassy last week for a concert by a 19-year old piano virtuoso. My favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISGfuAWKrKw" target="_blank">piece</a> was the Rachmaninoff Études-Tableaux in C minor.</p>

        <p>Today, I also went to the Kenyan Embassy for a conversation on the recent Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (<a href="https://odi.org/en/insights/focac-2024-a-revival-of-china-africa-relations/" target="_blank">FOCAC</a>) conference and Africa-China relations more broadly. At least, that's how it was advertised. We ended up talking about different notions of community, Africa-centered international relations, and Africa's role in the world more broadly. Interesting discussion!</p>

        <p>And it's no Colorado sunset, but the views from the Kenyan embassy were pretty sweet.</p>

        <p>Afterward, we cooked burritos in the DA kitchen, which was really nice until Immo informed the group that German men prefer to pee sitting down (when given the choice). They're apparently taught that peeing while standing is uncultured/unhygienic. I'm still processing the full impact of this disclosure, but I just thought you all should know.</p>
        
        <p>Oh and also! The German word for "meerkat" is "Erdmännchen," which translates directly to "little earth man." I quite like that.</p>
