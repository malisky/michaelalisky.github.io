        <p>Hello all! I'm still alive.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, I visited the Ascension Cathedral, one of the tallest churches in the world constructed entirely out of wood (and supposedly without nails).</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        
        <p>Inside, I chatted with Chinese tourists, and we took a group photo. They showed me pictures of their hometown in Xinjiang, whose natural landscape closely resembled Kazakhstan's. Trade with Xinjiang now accounts for 40% of all Kazakh-China trade, and bilateral migration and infrastructure investment have expanded dramatically in recent years. I'm curious what Kazakh citizens think of these developments.</p>
        
        <p>Next I went to the Arasan bathhouse, a massive, modernist complex built in 1982 at the behest of Dinmukhamed Kunayev. I visited during off-peak hours (around 12:30 pm), where the average age among patrons was around 60, and the average articles of clothing worn was around 0.2.</p>

        <p>The баня (bath house) is one of my favorite Russian institutions. Bathers alternate between multiple steam rooms and cold plunges as a form of contrast hydrotherapy. Most people wear felt hats to protect their heads from the extreme heat. You also are supposed to smack yourself and each other with веники, bundles of leaves (traditionally birch), for medicinal/sado-masochistic purposes.</p>
        
        <p>Inside, people of all ages come together to exchange stories and jokes. Someone invited me out for a beer, and another man introduced himself as the Vice President of the China-Russia Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        
        <p>I think civil society in the US would benefit from having places like Arasan, especially given how few bowling leagues there are nowadays. With a massage, the whole thing cost me less than $7.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I also got lunch at a Kazakh restaurant with Aida, the director of the think tank I'm working at. Some highlights from the meal include: baursak (semi-sweet donuts), kuurdak (stewed liver with onions and potato), beshbarmak (egg noodles with boiled horse meat!), and chak-chak (deep fried unleavened dough, the national dish of Tatarstan).</p>

        <p>I rarely eat meat, but I wanted to see what traditional food from the region looks like. Horse meat (конина) tastes pretty much like beef but with a gamier texture.</p>
        
        <p>I'm excited to meet the rest of the team tomorrow. Jet lag has been brutal, so I'll get to bed pretty quickly. Until next time!</p>
