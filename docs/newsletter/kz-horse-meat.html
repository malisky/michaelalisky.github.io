        <p>Hello! Still alive.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, I visited the Ascension Cathedral, one of the tallest churches in the world constructed entirely out of wood (and without nails!). Will someone who knows more speak to whether (allegedly) filling one's water bottle with holy water is sacrilegious?</p>

        <p>Inside, I chatted with Chinese tourists who wasted no time asking for a group photo. They showed me pictures of their hometown in Xinjiang, which looked very similar to Kazakhstan. Nowadays, <a href="https://astanatimes.com/2023/10/kazakhstan-xinjiang-reiterate-commitment-to-deepen-ties-in-priority-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trade</a> with Xinjiang accounts for 40% of all Kazakh-China trade, and bilateral migration and infrastructure investment have exploded. I'm curious what Kazakh citizens think of these developments.</p>
        
        <p>Next I went to the Arasan bathhouse, a massive, modernist complex built in 1982 at the behest of Communist leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinmukhamed_Kunaev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dinmukhamed Kunayev</a>. I visited during off-peak hours (around 12:30 pm), where the average age among patrons was around 60, and the average number of bathing suits per person was around 0.2 (the baths are separated by gender).</p>

        <p>The –±–∞–Ω—è (bath house) is one of my favorite Russian institutions. Bathers alternate between multiple steam rooms, each containing a different humidity level and temperature, and cold plunges as a form of contrast hydrotherapy. Some people wore felt hats to protect their heads from the extreme heat but basically nothing else, save for a towel. People also used –≤–µ–Ω–∏–∫–∏, bundles of leaves (traditionally birch), to smack the absolute crap out of each other (for medicinal purposes). This <a href="https://caravanistan.com/kazakhstan/almaty/arasan-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> has pictures of what the baths actually look like.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Inside, people of all ages came together to exchange stories and jokes. Someone invited me out for a beer, and the Vice President of the China-Russia Chamber of Commerce (who was sort of running the show) gave me his business card. You can read more about Dr. Ermek at his <a href="https://doctorericmed.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> or at this presentation I made about him <a href="/Presentation 1.24.25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="pdf-link">here</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I think civil society in the US would benefit from having places like this, especially given how few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bowling leagues</a> there are nowadays. Including a massage, the whole thing cost me less than $7.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I got lunch at a Kazakh restaurant with Aida, the director of the think tank I'm working at. We had a really lovely conversation and came up with lots of ideas for research. Some highlights from the meal include: baursak (semi-sweet donuts), kuurdak (stewed liver with onions and potato), beshbarmak (egg noodles with boiled horse meat!), and chak-chak (deep fried unleavened dough, the national dish of Tatarstan).</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>I very rarely eat meat in my daily life, but I wanted to try what traditional food from the region looks like. Horse meat (–∫–æ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞) tastes pretty much like beef but with a gamier texture.</p>
        
        <p>I'll meet the rest of the team tomorrow, which I'm super excited about. Jet lag has been kicking my butt (it's around 8:30 PM and I've been awake for the last 18 hours?). I'll get to bed pretty quick but don't hesitate to Skype me if there's something urgent.</p>
