        <p>After arriving in Beijing, we headed straight for the Dandelion school, a non-profit educational facility serving China's domestic migrant children.
           Thanks to China's <em>hukou</em> (household registration) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1068/a33194" target="_blank">system</a>, one's place of birth determines access to public services, including
           education, healthcare, and housing. Among China's <a href="https://chinadevelopmentbrief.org/reports/the-status-of-chinas-migrant-children/" target="_blank">71 million</a> migrant children, many recieve little or no schooling at all,
           and those who do manage to enroll in ordinary public schools face <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/709429" target="_blank">systematic</a> discrimination as teachers divert time and resources toward students who are eligble for
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/709429" target="_blank">middle school entrance exams</a>. This exclusion reflects a broader <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305741004000025" target="_blank">discourse</a> positioning rural migrants as inherently inferior. 
            Places like Dandelion school have thus become essential <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03050068.2022.2088691" target="_blank">empowerment</a> spaces, offering not just education but hope for breaking cycles of exclusion. Today, the school provides quality
             education and a nurturing environment for over <a href="https://www.konecentennialfoundation.org/the-dandelion-school" target="_blank">500 students</a> from low-income migrant families.</p>

        <p>Also, I redeemed my last airball imbroglio by hitting a game-winning three pointer in a pickup basketball game.</p>
