        <p>Last week, I tried fermented horse milk, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kumis</a> (not a great name), the national drink of Kazakhstan. It’s a little sweet and very acidic, and it’s believed to have medicinal properties.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        
        <p>According to friar William of <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/culture/food/rubruck2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rubruck</a>, a French monk who visited the Mongol Empire in the thirteenth-century, Kumis “is pungent… When a man has finished drinking, it leaves a taste of milk of almonds on the tongue, and it makes the inner man most joyful and also intoxicates weak heads, and greatly provokes urine.” </p>
        
        <p>I was alright on that last front, but to be honest, kumis is not my favorite fermented milk drink I’ve ever had. Kefir is much nicer.</p>

          />
        </div>
        
        <p>I had the horse milk with plov (pilaf), which was delicious as always, but the more traditional pairing is beshbarmak (horse meat with egg noodles). I had gone horseback riding earlier that day, so eating horse meat would have felt wrong.</p>

        <p>I promise I’ll stop perseverating about kumis after this email, but you might be surprised to learn that horse milk <a href="https://ker.com/equinews/mares-milk-a-closer-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has</a> extremely high levels of lactose compared to other mammals. During <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0958694621000935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fermentation</a>, much of this lactose converts to lactic acid, but enough simple sugars remain to support yeast fermentation. In other words, kumis ends up being mildly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/kumis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alcoholic</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The other day, I went to the Green Bazar, where I met an older gentleman named Bakitnur selling eggs. After chatting for a while, he informed me he really liked Kamala Harris, and he gifted me a bag of homemade fermented cheese curds (from horse milk) called <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/kurt-kurut-dried-cheese-kyrgyzstan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kurut</a>. They were quite dry and super salty but tasted pretty good!</p>

        <p>I’m enjoying Almaty so much. This morning, I went on a run near Medeu, the highest ice-skating rink in the world, with some friends. They wouldn’t let me eat what I assumed were blueberries. Probably the right call.</p>

        <p>After that, I went to the banya and checked out a few bookstores. I’m in Kazakhstan for just two more weeks, but I wish it was more. I’ve only scratched the surface of all the cool stuff to do here!</p>
        <p>This is the fourth email I’ll have sent out, and if you haven’t received the previous ones and would like to read them, please let me know. Otherwise, happy adventures, everyone!</p>
