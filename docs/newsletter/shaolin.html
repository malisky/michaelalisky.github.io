        <p>Dear all,</p>

        <p>I don't have much to say about Shaolin Temple, except that it's incredibly commercialized and kind of sad. At any given moment, approximately 120,000 people are here training in Kung Fu at the birthplace of Zen Buddhism and Chinese martial arts.</p>

        <p>After a tiring hike, we stumbled across a group of young trainees on an evening run. Their counselor, a monk on a scooter, chased after them, yelling, <q>faster!</q> (快一点). It seemed amusing at first until we saw a literal three-year-old among the group, crying as his little feet pitter-pattered up the path. Yes, you read that right: children as young as three are allowed to board here to undergo rigorous training. What has our world come to?</p>

        <p>From what I gathered, it seems basically like child abuse. I guess it's the price to pay to create kids so astonishingly flexible; they were seriously stretchy.</p>

        <p>Oh, and as of a few days ago, the head abbot/<q>CEO monk</q> of the temple was placed under criminal <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/28/china/china-shaolin-abbot-shi-yongxin-investigation-intl-hnk" target="_blank">investigation</a> for suspected embezzlement and <q>improper relationships</q> with women. Enlightening stuff going on here, indeed.</p>

        <p>My favorite part of the visit to Zhengzhou was climbing up to the Dharma Cave, emerging drenched in sweat and possibly a bit wiser. It was
             in this cave that Bodhidharma, the Indian monk credited with founding Chan (Zen) Buddhism, meditated facing a wall for nine years in silent
              retreat during the 5th century (but if <em>I</em> don't leave my room for a week, it's called <q>depression</q>... go figure). The cave
               remains a quiet, austere spot nestled high in the cliffs above the temple complex, except someone has placed a bunch of water bottles and gimcracks in the entryway.</p>

        <p>I also liked the nearby Zhongyue Daoist temple, which unlike the Shaolin grounds below, seemed to serve patrons who were genuinely there to worship. Even self-professed atheists
             reflexively pause to burn incense or bow three times before passing the main hall. <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18755783/t/The-Souls-of-China-The-Return-of-Religion-After-Mao" target="_blank">While terms like “religion”</a>
              carry baggage in the post-Mao era, the older language of ritual and faith remains quietly embedded in everyday life.</p>

        <p>State-sanctioned temples like Zhongyue occupy a curious middle ground, functioning at once as sites of devotion and instruments of cultural policy.</p>
