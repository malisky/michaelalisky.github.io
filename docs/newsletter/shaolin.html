        <p>Dear all,</p>

        <p>I don't have much to say about Shaolin Temple, except that it's incredibly commercialized and kind of sad. 7 million tourists <a href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/381673">descend</a> upon Shaolin a year, and at any given moment, approximately 120,000 people are here training in Kung Fu. At the birthplace of Zen Buddhism and Chinese martial arts, several patrons excitedly asked for my autograph, mistaking me for 7'4 French basketball phenom <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45486750/victor-wembanyama-midst-stay-shaolin-temple-china">Victor Wembanyama</a>, who underwent a <q>spiritual journey</q> through 10 days of training here earlier this summer.</p>

        <p>After a tiring hike, we stumbled across a group of young trainees on an evening run. Their counselor, a monk on a scooter, chased after them, yelling, <q>faster!</q> (快一点).
          It seemed amusing at first until we saw a literal three-year-old among the group, crying as his little feet pitter-pattered upon the stones.
           Yes, you read that right: children as young as three board here to begin their kung fu educations. I have to imagine these kids end up emotionally stunted, or maybe just very enlightened.
           Maybe they're <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12505.The_Idiot">the same thing</a>. Who knows.</p>

        <p>From what I gathered, it seems basically like child abuse. I guess it's the price to pay to create kids so astonishingly flexible; they were seriously stretchy.</p>

        <p>Oh, and as of a few days ago, the head abbot/<q>CEO monk</q> of the temple was placed under criminal <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/28/china/china-shaolin-abbot-shi-yongxin-investigation-intl-hnk" target="_blank">investigation</a> for suspected embezzlement and <q>improper relationships</q> with women. Go figure.</p>

        <p>My favorite part of the visit to Zhengzhou was climbing up to the Dharma Cave, emerging drenched in sweat and possibly a bit wiser. It was
             in this cave that Bodhidharma, the Indian monk credited with founding Chan (Zen) Buddhism, meditated facing a wall for nine years in silent
              retreat during the 5th century (but if I don't leave my room for a week, it's called <q>depression</q>... go figure). The cave
               remains a quiet, austere spot nestled high in the cliffs above the temple complex, except someone has placed a bunch of water bottles and gimcracks in the entryway.</p>

        <p>I wonder if <q>perfected action</q> comes from repeated training, or more from achieving the right mindset. I'm reminded of this passage from the <em>Zhuangzi</em>:</p>

        <blockquote class="poetry-quote">
          <p>Yan Hui said, <q>May I ask what is the fasting of the mind?</q></p>
          <p>Confucius said, <q>You must concentrate your attention. Do not listen with your ears, but with your mind; do not comprehend with your mind, but with your vital energy. Your ears can only hear and your mind can only comprehend. But the vital energy is an emptiness that is responsive to anything. The mighty Tao can only gather in an emptiness and that emptiness is the fasting of the mind.</q></p>
          <p>Yan Hui said, <q>Before I learned about the fasting of the mind, I had been conscious of myself. Now… I am no longer conscious of myself. Can this be called emptiness?</q></p>
          <p>Confucius said, <q>Absolutely right...</q></p>
          <cite>— Chapter 4 (Watson Translation)</cite>

        <p>I also liked the nearby Zhongyue Daoist temple, which unlike the Shaolin grounds below, seemed to serve patrons who were genuinely there to worship. While terms like <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18755783/t/The-Souls-of-China-The-Return-of-Religion-After-Mao" target="_blank">“religion”</a>
          carry baggage in the post-Mao era, the older language of ritual and faith remains quietly embedded in everyday life. Even self-professed atheists
             reflexively pause to burn incense or bow three times before passing the main hall.</p>

        <p>State-sanctioned temples like Zhongyue occupy a curious middle ground, functioning at once as sites of devotion and instruments of cultural policy. This sign at Zhongyue outlines Xi Jinping thought on the Sinocization of religion, encouraging domestic religious groups to resist <q>domination by foreign forces.</q></p>

        <p>At any rate, I think this little guy really has <em>wu wei</em> (无为) figured out.</p>
