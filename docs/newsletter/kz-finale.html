        <p><em>Reflections on Kazakhstan</em></p>
        
        <p>Hello all! It's been a while since my last update (thank you, Kidus, for the reminder). I wrapped up my internship in Kazakhstan a few days ago and am en route home (but not before a quick trip to Japan).</p>
        
        <p>I figured I'd take a moment to share some miscellaneous stories and pictures that didn't make my initial round of emails while reflecting on the experience of living in Kazakhstan more broadly.</p>
        
        <p>Until next time,</p>
        
        <p>Michael</p>

        <p>Almaty really grew on me. I've been to places that have an initial "wow" factor, something you read about yet can't quite believe you're finally seeing with your own eyes.</p>
        
        <p>Almaty, on the other hand, is not so flashy. It was founded in 1854, and its architecture feels similar to places in Russia I've visited. I've never seen a movie that takes place in Almaty, nor have I really met people from Kazakhstan back in the US.</p>
        
        <p>The city's natural surroundings, on the other hand, are breathtaking. A big part of why I came here in the first place was to go into the mountains and have my own adventures, inspired by my mom's stories from when she backpacked through Central Asia at around my current age.</p>
        
        <p>Unsurprisingly, interning at a think tank made me spend a lot of time in the city. I used my weekends and evenings to explore, and in that time, I found Almaty to be a city that constantly one-upped itself. I am so grateful for the wealth of new experiences and the chance to create a new routine. I think it's helped teach me how to approach life with a sense of open-mindedness and excitement.</p>
        
        <p>The people I met in Kazakhstan, through and through, were kind, curious, and welcoming. I haven't ever met so many strangers who readily initiate conversations, from wanting to practice English, to making personal probes, to randomly interjecting observations or jokes as we waited in line at a restaurant.</p>
        
        <p>I've found a place I'm excited to one day return to, and I'm grateful to have had so many new experiences and to have met so many wonderful people. And I'm very happy I was able to practice my Russian.</p>
        
        <p>A few people have asked me about what actual work I've been doing, which is a fair question. I promise I did work hard, most days from 9-5. In addition to editing and assisting with existing projects, I'm working on two new analytic pieces, one about Chinese railway infrastructure development in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, and another comparative project about Chinese development finance in Africa and Central Asia. They'll hopefully be out in the next few months. I spent a lot of time reading, translating, meeting with local scholars and experts, and engaging with civil society actors.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks so much for reading my emails. Writing these updates has been a good opportunity for reflection and a useful way to stay connected with the people I care about during a time when I would otherwise be pretty isolated. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone soon.</p>
