        <p><em>Environmental challenges and natural wonders</em></p>
        
        <p>Hello all!</p>
        
        <p>Today was day one of a conference on Climate Change Education hosted by the think tank I've been interning at.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        <p>Already, 3/10 of Central Asia's 79 million inhabitants lack access to safe drinking water, droughts have led to widespread livestock and crop failures, and polluted air causes thousands of premature excess deaths every year.</p>
        
        <p>The root causes of these crises include excessive dependency on coal, mismanagement of natural resources, and challenges facilitating cross-border cooperation.</p>
        
        <p>Surprisingly, the academic community has all but neglected climate change: out of 13,488 journal articles published between 1991-2021 in eight key journals for Central Asia research, only 33 articles (0.24%) were on climate change or a related topic. A lack of understanding on these issues, especially among senior policymakers, limits progress. It is partially for these reasons that UNESCO argues "education is crucial to promote climate action."</p>

        <p>As I mentioned previously, I also spent this past weekend hiking and exploring a bit of Kazakhstan's natural beauty. Spending time outside is the best way to cement one's sense of urgency about climate action, serving as a poignant reminder of what's at stake.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to visiting Lake Kaindy, on Sunday I also explored the Kolsai lakes (I learned better than to try to swim this time) and a few canyons near the Kazakh-Chinese border.</p>

        <p>Our tour guide referred to Charyn Canyon, pictured below, as the "younger brother of the Grand Canyon," confidently informing us that the original was in Colorado. I put on my trail running shoes and ran a few kilometers to the bank of the Charyn river. The variety of landscapes and ecosystems in Kazakhstan is remarkable to me.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>I also visited the Lunar Canyon, where someone let me take a picture with their eagle for $2 (I'm on the right).</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        <p>That's all for now, as the conference will resume shortly. I hope everyone is enjoying this last week of August!</p>
