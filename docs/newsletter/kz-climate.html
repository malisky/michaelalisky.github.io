        <p>Hello all!</p>
        
        <p>Today was day one of a conference on Climate Change Education hosted by the think tank I've been interning at.</p>

        <p>Already, 3/10 of Central Asia's 79 million inhabitants lack <a href="https://eurasianet.org/perspectives-clock-is-ticking-as-central-asia-confronts-water-calamity" target="_blank">access</a> to safe drinking water, droughts have led to <a href="https://eurasianet.org/kazakh-social-media-rings-alarm-about-drought-livestock-die-off" target="_blank">widespread</a> livestock and crop failures, and polluted air causes <a href="https://www.undp.org/kazakhstan/blog/cleaning-air-and-improving-peoples-health-almaty" target="_blank">thousands</a> of premature excess deaths every year.</p>
        
        <p>The root causes of these crises include <a href="https://eurasianet.org/central-asian-states-have-a-coal-dependency-problem-report#:~:text=Plans%20to%20add%20generating%20capacity,electricity%20production%20in%20the%20region." target="_blank">excessive dependency</a> on coal, <a href="https://astanatimes.com/2024/01/oxford-researcher-suggests-measures-to-address-central-asias-water-crisis/" target="_blank">mismanagement</a> of natural resources, and <a href="https://astanatimes.com/2021/02/cross-border-water-cooperation-in-central-asia-past-present-future/" target="_blank">challenges</a> facilitating cross-border cooperation.</p>
        
        <p>Surprisingly, the academic community has all but <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02634937.2022.2059447" target="_blank">neglected</a> climate change: out of 13,488 journal articles published between 1991-2021 in eight key journals for Central Asia research, only 33 articles (0.24%) were on climate change or a related topic. A lack of understanding on these issues, especially among senior policymakers, limits progress. It is partially for these reasons that UNESCO <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/node/66349" target="_blank">argues</a> "education is crucial to promote climate action."</p>

        <p>As I mentioned previously, I also spent this past weekend hiking and exploring a bit of Kazakhstan's natural beauty. Spending time outside is the best way to cement one's sense of urgency about climate action, serving as a poignant reminder of what's at stake.</p>

        <p>In addition to visiting Lake Kaindy, on Sunday I also explored the Kolsai lakes (I learned better than to try to swim this time) and a few canyons near the Kazakh-Chinese border.</p>

        <p>Our tour guide referred to Charyn Canyon, pictured above, as the "younger brother of the Grand Canyon," confidently informing us that the original was in Colorado. I put on my trail running shoes and ran a few kilometers to the bank of the Charyn river. The variety of landscapes and ecosystems in Kazakhstan is remarkable to me.</p>

        <p>I also visited the Lunar Canyon, where someone let me take a picture with their eagle for $2 (I'm on the right).</p>

        <p>That's all for now, as the conference will resume shortly. I hope everyone is enjoying this last week of August!</p>
