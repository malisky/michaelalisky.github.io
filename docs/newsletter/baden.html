        <p>Week two in Austria has been busy, and I have been müde (tired)! My time here has been filled with impressive art, wandersome adventures, questionable sandwiches, and wonderful new friends.</p>
        
        <p>Last weekend, I took a trip to Baden, a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its Roman baths and Biedermeier culture, where Beethoven <a href="https://www.tourismus.baden.at/en/beethoven-in-baden" target="_blank">composed</a> major parts of his 9th Symphony. One can almost imagine the composer strolling through the town's elegant Art Nouveau villas, humming <q>Ode to Joy</q> while sipping on local wine (still waiting for him to drop the next album).</p>

        <p>Our journey was perhaps… a bit less refined… 60+ future diplomats (yours truly included) embarked on a boisterous bacchanal through Baden's famed vineyards, stopping every 20 minutes to try different types of <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/sturm" target="_blank">Sturm</a>, a fermented grape juice well on its way to becoming wine. It<q>s important to remember that, much like Sturm, we</q>re all just works in progress.</p>

        <p>After finally reaching the restaurant some four hours later, we ate a girl dinner (crackers and cheese) with, of course, more wine. All in the name of international relations.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, the school year officially started with an inauguration at the Rathaus, Vienna's City Hall. My main takeaway is that Vienna must be an exceptionally well-run city if taxpayers are willing to fund such bougie office space for their local government.</p>

        <p>Also, as a student from Austria informed me, that is indeed the flag of Vienna, not Indonesia.</p>

        <p>The event featured a bizarre documentary about the OG sauced up white boy and DA alumni, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, and concluded with a speech by Volker Türk, current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
        
        <p>After class the other day, I also visited the Belvedere, one of a few palace complexes in Vienna not built by the Hapsburgs (it was the residence of French expat and renowned short king, Eugene of Savoy). In 1955, the museum hosted the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, reestablishing Austria as a sovereign state after World War II.</p>

        <p>Other recent highlights include the Museum of Military History, bachata dancing in my room, and this rock, Ivan.</p>

        <p>Classes have been great — I<q>m especially enjoying German, which I</q>m taking at the A1 level (<q>bloody beginner</q>). On the first day, I told the teacher I liked apples and water, which has naturally resulted in her calling me <q>Apfel Wasser.</q></p>
        
        <p>I<q>m also taking a class on the History of Economic Thought and Methodology, which has explored Carl Menger</q>s subjectivism, as well as a China seminar with a professor even more chaotic than Scott Rozelle.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, the vibes are great, and it<q>s so nice to be somewhere where I can walk and think, and think and walk. The people couldn</q>t be nicer, and it's been a real privilege to have so much free time for adventures.</p>
        
        <p>Missing you guys, and until next time,<br/>Michael</p>
