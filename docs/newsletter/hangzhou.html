        <p>At 6am, Rahul and I took a walk around the fog-adorned Xihu, or West Lake. We reflected on life, love, and Stanford, and we saw many old people and a few Douyin influencers. I think old people have it pretty good in China. They hang out together, practice <em>tai chi</em>, play cards, and gossip. Ninety percent of China's elderly receive care at home, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-ages-investors-bet-they-can-beat-retirement-home-stigma-2023-03-03/">compared</a> with three percent in nursing homes and sevent percent in community-level assistance facilities. As we chatted with a few garrulous old men, the hazy mountains around Xihu were indeed marvelous in the rain.</p>

        <p>Xihu is the crown jewel of Hangzhou, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has inspired poets and painters for over a thousand years, and part of the reason why Marco Polo once called Hangzhou "the finest and most splendid city in the world." I can only imagine what he might have said if he had seen Aurora, Colorado.</p>
        
        <p>In the old town, our group decked out in traditional (and culturally appropriate) Peking Opera-style (<em>jingju</em>) makeup. I was Zhou Que, a cunning and treacherous villain, which I thought was fitting since people here really like it when I refer to myself as <em>yang guizi</em> (foreign devil).</p>

        <p>At the 'Doo Crafts' factory (the name could probably be better), we watched employees apply tape to boxes with mesmerizing, rhythmic precision. It was as if Butcher Ding had traded his cleaver for tape dispensers and ox carcasses for DIY bead kits:</p>

        <blockquote class="poetry-quote">
          <p>Cook Ting was cutting up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. As every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee — zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou music.</p>

        <p>Our last night in Hangzhou was spent at Gongyan, an immersive performance set during the Song Dynasty that
           told the story of Su Dongpo (Su Shi), a poet, statesman, and once-governor of Hangzhou. It began with his 
           marriage and quiet domestic happiness, followed by the death of his wife and his exile from court (just like my freshman year at Stanford).
            Snow began to fall indoors. A single line of poetry pierced the silence:</p>

        <blockquote class="poetry-quote">
          <p class="chinese">十年生死两茫茫，不思量，自难忘。</p>
          <p class="translation">“Ten years of life and death, both so vast and unclear; without thinking of you, it's still impossible to forget.”</p>

        <p>Also at a tea farm in the outskirts of Hangzhou, I met a nice cat and roasted fresh Longjing (Dragon Well) tea.</p>

        <p>All six types of tea can be made from the same leaf: green, white, yellow, oolong, black, and red. Like most things in life, it all comes down to one's oxidation levels and determination.</p>

        <p>The workers were impressed with my technique; they said they had never seen a foreigner as talented or handsome as me. I humbly accepted their praise but turned down a request to name me the town's mayor (I am joking, but village elections in China are surprisingly <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/abs/elections-and-power-the-locus-of-decisionmaking-in-chinese-villages/A6803EB814F116998B87C478EB1596E5">competitive</a>). I signed a few autographs, shook a few hands, and we departed for Shanghai.</p>
        
        <p>There, I caught up with my friend Yuxuan  over dinner and got drinks on a rooftop bar overlooking the Bund.</p>

        <p>Earlier that day, I also got scammed at a local market and went to a digital government service center to try to complain.</p>

        <p>It's worth noting, the last time I was in Shanghai, I visited the marriage market in People's Park, where old people gather to trade resumes of their children, complete with photos, salaries, <em>hukou</em> status, and zodiac signs. One of the matchmaker aunties grabbed me and said, "you have nice skin" (皮肤, pífū), but I misheard and thought she said "you have a nice 屁股 (pìgu)." Flustered, but not deterred, I responded "你也不错".</p>
