        <p>Isabelle has informed me I should begin my messages with a more pleasant greeting. With that in mind:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left:4em;">
          <li>Sorry</li>
          <li>What's up gamers<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang" target="_blank">â€½</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>In the morning, I visited the Kazan Cathedral, the oldest church in Almaty. I enjoyed the sound of choral music and the rich smell of incense as the rain gently drizzled outside during a Sunday service.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Recent renovations <a href="https://cabar.asia/en/cave-temple-in-almaty-how-church-services-were-held-during-stalin-s-repressions" target="_blank">revealed</a> an extensive underground cave system beneath the cathedral. Due to state-mandated atheism in the 1930s, Kazakhstan's Orthodox community used these catacombs to hold surreptitious church services.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Inside the cave temple, I found beautiful artifacts and icons, including some books written in Church Slavonic.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, Kazakhstan is a majority Muslim country, and on Friday, I visited the Central Mosque just before the Salat al Maghrib, which was also beautiful.</p>

        <p>After leaving the Cathedral this morning, I walked around for a bit before stumbling upon a pigeon market! There were maybe ten or fifteen old guys hanging out and selling, trading, and admiring each other's birds. They apparently do this every Sunday, and the whole thing was surprisingly tender.</p>

        <p>The pigeons all have names, and most of these gentlemen have been raising birds since they were young. I even got to hold some of the pigeons.</p>

        <p>Pigeons generally have <a href="https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/pigeons/footfeathering/" target="_blank">scales</a> on their feet, but a lot of these ones had fancy feathers!</p>

        <p>As if today couldn't get any better, I also found Russian red squirrels at the Almaty Botanical Garden! I like all squirrels (except for the ones at Stanford) but red ones are definitely my favorite. During winter, they develop huge fluffy <a href="https://www.animal.photos/mammal/squ-red2.htm" target="_blank">tufts</a> on their ears.</p>

        <p>That<q>s all for now. I wasn</q>t planning on sending another email so soon, but today was epic.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading and take care!</p>
