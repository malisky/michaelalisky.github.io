        <p>Isabelle has informed me I should begin my messages with a more pleasant greeting. With that in mind:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left:1.5em;">
          <li>Sorry</li>
          <li>What's up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang" target="_blank">gamersâ€½</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the morning, I visited the Kazan Cathedral, the oldest church in Almaty. I enjoyed the sound of choral music and the rich smell of incense as the rain gently drizzled outside during a Sunday service.</p>

        <p>Recent renovations revealed <a href="https://cabar.asia/en/cave-temple-in-almaty-how-church-services-were-held-during-stalin-s-repressions" target="_blank">an extensive underground cave system</a> beneath the cathedral. Due to state-mandated atheism in the 1930s, Kazakhstanâ€™s Orthodox community used these catacombs to hold surreptitious church services.</p>

        <p>Inside the cave temple, I found beautiful artifacts and icons, including some books written in Church Slavonic.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, Kazakhstan is a majority Muslim country, and on Friday, I visited the Central Mosque just before the Salat al Maghrib, which was also beautiful.</p>

        <p>After leaving the Cathedral this morning, I walked around for a bit before stumbling upon a pigeon market! There were maybe ten or fifteen old guys hanging out and selling, trading, and admiring each otherâ€™s birds. They apparently do this every Sunday, and the whole thing was surprisingly tender.</p>

        <p>The pigeons all have names, and most of these gentlemen have been raising birds since they were young. I even got to hold some of the pigeons.</p>
        <p>Pigeons generally have <a href="https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/pigeons/footfeathering/" target="_blank">scales</a> on their feet, but a lot of these ones had fancy feathers!</p>
        <p>As if today couldnâ€™t get any better, I also found Russian red squirrels at the Almaty Botanical Garden! I like all squirrels (except for the ones at Stanford) but red ones are definitely my favorite. During winter, they develop huge fluffy <a href="https://www.animal.photos/mammal/squ-red2.htm" target="_blank">tufts</a> on their ears.</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s all for now. I wasnâ€™t planning on sending another email so soon, but today was epic.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading and take care!</p>
