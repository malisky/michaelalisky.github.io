        <p>On Sunday, I graduated with my master's degree, bade a tearful goodbye to my friends, dropped my parents off at the airport, packed up my room, and rushed to catch a midnight flight to Hong Kong.</p>

        <p>I'm currently on a bus to Shenzhen, and the primary emotion I'm feeling right now is eepy. But I'm also overflowing with gratitude and excitement for what's to come. The last five or six years at Stanford are hard to describe, let alone understand, but I feel like I'm heading into the world with a kind of momentum and optimism that have, at times, eluded me. I know things that freshman me wanted to know, and far more things have come to me that I was not wise enough to even know I wanted to know.</p>

        <div class="image-container"><img loading="lazy" src="../images-optimized/graduation/graduation-7.jpeg"/></div>

        <p>As I finally leave, things feel kind of right, and I'm ready to go. I'm more focused, appreciative, and sure of myself than I've ever been before. Part of that comes from the adventure ahead, but mostly it comes from the support and love of my friends and family. I'm sure the sadness of leaving will hit soon, but for now, I feel happy.</p>

        <p>Over the last few years, I've faced challenges and heartbreaks, disappointments and consternations. But I've also begun to learn how to use these moments of groundlessness (<a href="https://billmoyers.com/content/pema-chadron/" target="_blank">source</a>), when it feels like the rug has been pulled out from beneath me, as opportunities to reassess and replant my feet with greater conviction. I can choose where I land and move forward on new terms.</p>

        <p>At Stanford, I've found people who see me clearly. I've developed my voice and pursued my curiosities. I've traveled the world and read (a lot), and I've learned from some of the best. I've had a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>In other news, which will surprise perhaps no one, I'll be in China, mostly in Beijing, until December. I'm slowly warming to the idea of maybe applying for a job at some point. I also hope to get better at salsa dancing.</p>

        <p>To that end, dearest readers, please do let me know if you'll be in town, or if you'd like to send me devotions or remunerative gifts, or if you have reading recommendations. I can forward you my shipping address and SWIFT info.</p>

        <p>My time in China begins with a research trip alongside my academic advisor, Scott Rozelle, and two dozen Stanford students, including Celo and Rahul. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>

        <p>Today started at 5 a.m. when we landed in Hong Kong. After a quick hotel breakfast and a shower, we headed to Hong Kong University, a brick-lined urban rainforest whose compactness belied its proprioceptive height, perched a few hundred meters in the air and revealed now and then by sweeping glimpses of the harbor.</p>

        <p>We had lunch with the city's Minister of Treasury, who rattled off Hong Kong's rankings in global financial competitiveness, tax simplicity, and regulatory openness, displaying considerable stamina and lung capacity during his rhodomontade on the city he clearly adores.</p>

        <p>Eugene, a local community college lecturer who moonlights as a tour guide, narrated the city's development as we drove through the rain-dappled streets. The clouds hung low, sprinkling intermittently, just enough to remind us of their presence.</p>

        <p>In a mall bookstore, I read the first chapter of McCarthy's <em>Blood Meridian</em> before Celo and I set off in search of street food. We settled for sandwiches from 7/11 and hurried back to the bus.</p>

        <p>I hope to have more time in the coming weeks to reflect on what it means to leave Stanford, but one thing that needs no distillation is the gratitude I feel for the friends who've been a part of this journey, those whom I was able to find photos of, and otherwise. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I also decided to upload my past newsletters to a personal website, which you can now view at <a href="https://www.michaelalisky.com" target="_blank">www.michaelalisky.com</a>. If you find any bugs or client-side errors, keep them to yourself.</p>
