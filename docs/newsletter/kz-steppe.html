        <p>Hello all!</p>
        <p>Today I visited <a href="https://steppeandworld.kz/en/catalog?statuses%5B0%5D=1" target="_blank">Steppe & World</a>, one of the biggest Kazakh-language publishing houses in Almaty. Their most successful project so far has been translating the Harry Potter series. Apparently, diverging from the standard Russian pronunciation (going from “Гарри,” pronounced “Gary,” to “Хәрри,” pronounced “Härri”) was a local cause célèbre. Russian linguistic practices remain deeply ingrained in much of the former Soviet Union, as is a sense of ownership or even in pride in Russian translations of world literature. Even my mom used to half-jokingly claim that “Shakespeare is best when read in the original Russian.”</p>

        <p>I met the director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raisa-kader-a90b367" target="_blank">Raisa</a>, who was born in Mongolia to a Kazakh family. She completed her undergraduate studies in Egypt and has also lived in the Netherlands, UK, and Germany. After visiting Kazakhstan in 2016, she noticed a striking lack of Kazakh-language books, particularly for children, and decided to establish a publishing house.</p>
        
        <p>The shortage of Kazakh books is rooted in Soviet-era policies. During this period, Almaty (then the capital) had only two Kazakh-language schools, with Russian dominating the education system. Collectivization, famines, and population transfers reduced ethnic Kazakhs to just 30% of the population. For those interested in a deeper dive into this history, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+kazakhstan+os+empty&oq=why+is+kazakhstan+os+empty&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDIxNzhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=47%3A11-,Why%20Kazakhstan%20is%20Insanely%20Empty,May%2010%2C%202024,-1.00" target="_blank">this video</a> provides an excellent overview.</p>

        </div>
        <p>While Kazakhs now comprise 69% of the population (compared to 15.5% Russians), the Russian language remains clearly prevalent. Russian proficiency (83.7%) is higher than Kazakh (80.1%), and in cosmopolitan centers like Almaty, many educated elites still view Kazakh as inferior to Russian.</p>

        </div>
        <p>However, efforts by civil society actors like Raisa coupled with government initiatives have led to a resurgence of the Kazakh language. Today, a significant portion of the younger generation is more comfortable speaking Kazakh than Russian — especially the further one gets from major cities. Yet these children lack engaging, age-appropriate Kazakh literature.</p>
        <p>Raisa passionately argues that access to literature in one’s native language represents a human right. She described the joy in young readers’ eyes when they finally received books they could understand, unable to put them down. She believes that the revival and modernization of the Kazakh language — whose speakers, for instance, often default to Russian grammar structures — can contribute to a broader movement of cultural reclamation.</p>

        <p>I walked away from Steppe & World feeling inspired — and with a free copy of a book which introduces the Kazakh language to English speakers. I’m grateful for this experience, and although I’m leaving Kazakhstan next week, I really hope to return one day.</p>
        <p>This weekend, I’ll be off the grid, as I’m going camping in the north slope of the Tian Shan Mountains. I’ll be sure to send lots of pictures when I return.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Рахмет! (Rakhmet: Thank you!) See you soon.</p>
