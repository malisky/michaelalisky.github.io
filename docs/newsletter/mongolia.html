        <p><em>Sand, storms, and sandstorms</em></p>
        
        <p>Long-time readers, devoted seminarians, cherished financial supporters: I'm currently sitting in Incheon International Airport in South Korea, enjoying a snack from the CU convenience store. I shake my head, and soft, vermillion sand trickles out of my ears.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, the city of Ulaanbaatar (UB) declared an emergency weather warning due to extreme gusts of wind and high risks of roofs blowing away. Nevertheless, our flight made it out of Mongolia this morning. I'm exhausted but sad to go. Next stop: Taiwan.</p>
        
        <p>As we entered the Gobi desert on Sunday, our driver, Choi, accidentally veered 10 miles off course into a sandstorm. Dust swallowed the air around us, and the sky turned the color of fermented goat milk. Curling wisps of sand ripped across the long road ahead, and we rubbed dish soap on the car's exterior to protect its paint. A few hundred kilometers south laid the border with China.</p>

        <p>Using a compass and intermittent bouts of cell service, we eventually found our Way. The melancholic discography of Lana del Rey, recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1jik87s/fake_news_lana_featured_in_billboard_mongolia/" target="_blank">named</a> Mongolia's 2025 Woman of the Year, and Choi's phone announcing sporadic Facetime calls from "Cat Face with Heart-Shaped Eyes" were the only interruptions to our tense, nervous silence. Boggie, the guide Julia found on Facebook, also occasionally proffered mandarin oranges.</p>

        <p>As we neared the Khongoryn Els "singing" sand dunes, a pair of headlights cut across the darkness. A white Prius, packed with ten or eleven people, answered our prayers. Because we were so late, the entire family whose <i>ger</i> we were staying in had come looking.</p>
        
        <p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurt" target="_blank">Gers</a></i>, also known as yurts in Turkic languages, evolved to suit nomadic pastoralism and transhumance from winter to summer pastures and back. These movable homes have been used continuously by nomads in Central and Inner Asia for thousands of years. Several generations live together under one roof.</p>

        <p>Flocks of sheep spilled over the dusty hills and scattered like the mist, and we rode ponies across the Mongolian steppe. Pujee, who fetched the semi-domesticated animals from across the hill on his dirtbike, told us he enjoys eating horse testicles (when presented the opportunity). He offered a few otherwise really profound bits of wisdom.</p>

        <p>We saw yaks and pikas and cinereous vultures as we hiked through ice-filled canyons in the Gurvan Saikhan mountains. In our <i>ger</i>, we burnt saxaul wood, coal, and dried animal dung to stay warm through the night. On Tuesday morning, we woke up to a snowstorm.</p>

        <p>Temperatures in the Gobi range from minus 40 to over 104 in Fahrenheit (that's 277 to 313 in Kelvin).</p>
        
        <p>Near the Flaming Cliffs paleontological site, winds shook our car, and grass and sheep dung disappeared, and soon there were no more traces of man or beast. We found dinosaur bones and ran headfirst through winds so strong it felt like skydiving (which I last did under rather inauspicious circumstances in Tracy, CA). Choi asked to take a picture (check his Facebook).</p>

        <p>After 10 hours on the road careering between oncoming traffic and potholes, we finally made it back to UB, the city where 50% of Mongolia's 3.4 million people live.</p>
        
        <p>Julia, Serena, Johanna, and I had spent the week before in UB for our MA capstone, where we worked with GerHub, a local NGO, to develop policy advocacy mechanisms and advance recommendations surrounding the president's "One Billion Trees Initiative." We met with members of Parliament, local bureaucrats, architects, start-up founders, mining magnates, think tank leaders, and one guy who reminded me of "Lord Business" from the Lego Movie.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Approximately 60% of UB's urban residents live in unplanned <i>ger</i> districts. Citizens face systemic exclusion from the provision of social services and inadequate infrastructure, including a lack of central heating, running water, and sewage systems, which contributes to enormous, striking inequality. Bilgee, who moved to UB 20 years ago and now runs a hot shower, auto shop, and convenience store, showed us his Bruce Lee posters and shared some fermented milk.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>More broadly, defining "modernity" in Mongolia is a difficult task. Mongolia as a country has only been independent since 1924 and was ruled by an authoritarian regime until 1990. In UB, <i>gers</i> exist alongside highrise buildings, reflecting the poverty of displaced rural Mongolians while also symbolizing continuity and respect for Mongol traditions.</p>
        
        <p>Over beers at an expat restaurant, Bat-Orgil, a young student who founded <a href="https://www.newnomad.org" target="_blank">the New Nomad Institute</a>, argued that Mongolia needs to embrace its nomadic roots in relation to climate adaptation, and later teach those lessons to other nations.</p>

        <p>I'm grateful for this adventure and for how much I learned, and I'm optimistic we can contribute something useful toward the many challenges we observed. My favorite moment on the trip probably came at the second <i>ger</i> Julia and I stayed at. Using Google Translate, I asked a young boy how old he was. In English, he confidently answered, "23." I asked him what he liked to do for fun. He thought for a bit before responding: "Hold baby goats."</p>
        
        <p>Until next time.<br/>Michael</p>
