        <p>Hello hello!</p>
        
        <p>This weekend, my friend Laura and I took a bus to Ljubljana, Slovenia, the city of Dragons, founded by Jason and the Argonauts, home to automatic raw milk vending machines.</p>

        <p>Non-homogenized, non-pasteurized, and no antibiotics. I went full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB4N9IK9bRY" target="_blank">BadlandsChugs</a>. I definitely regretted that, but at €1 a liter, you really can't beat the price. YOLO.</p>

        <p>Ljubljana is pretty, but the real beauty lies outside the city. On Saturday, we rented a car and drove to Lake Bled, a castle-adorned glacial lake located in the Julian Alps. We also found a very picturesque forest cat.</p>

        <p>A few miles away in the Triglav National Park, we hiked through the Vintgar Gorge and got lost in the woods after dark. Thankfully, my indefatigable spirit, innate sense of direction, and full access to Google Maps facilitated our safe return.</p>

        <p>The next day, we drove to Karst and learned about dolines, sinkholes that form when cave roofs erode away, creating staggering voids in the earth. As a geologic term, <q>doline</q> originates from the Slovenian language. When fog formed, the Big Collapse Doline, pictured below, was thought to be the gate to the underworld.</p>

        <p>I yearned for the mines, and Laura and I descended into the Škocjan caves (no pictures allowed). Walking along torch-lit, meandering staircases cut directly into the rock, surrounded by dripping stalactites, it felt like I was traveling through the tunnels of Moria (thankfully, no Balrogs).</p>
        
        <p>After an obligatory Krem cake, we drove to Trieste, Italy, an ancient Roman settlement which eventually became the Austrian empire's main sea port. A syncretism of imperial influences, this <q>Little Vienna on the Sea</q> boasted impressive neoclassical architecture, Habsburg-era coffee houses, and super legit gnocchi. I especially enjoyed hanging out in the Unity of Italy Square and wandering through the narrow lanes of the Jewish Ghetto.</p>

        <p>Back in Ljubljana, we visited the city castle, ate burek, and saw Slavoj Žižek and Melania Trump's alma mater. I stopped by the first pizza restaurant in ex-Yugoslavia.</p>

        <p>Slovenia was super stunning, and I'm already planning my next trip to the Balkans!</p>

        <p>Also, tonight is the US election, and the only thing scarier than the fact that our country's future rests in the hands of a few voters in rural Pennsylvania, is our award-winning Halloween costume (my head was too big to make the Uncle Fester bald cap work).</p>

        <p>Finally, it was so lovely to see the inimitable Sae Kobayashi, all the way from Indonesia!!</p>
