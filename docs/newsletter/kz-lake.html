        <p><em>Adventures to Lake Kaindy and Saty</em></p>
        
        <p>Hello hello!</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday, I hiked around Lake Kaindy, one of the coolest lakes I've ever seen.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

        <p>In 1911, a major earthquake <a href="https://rees.sas.upenn.edu/about/spotlight/kaindy-lake-kazakhstan" target="_blank">triggered</a> a limestone landslide that blocked the Kaindy river, creating a natural dam. The rising water flooded a valley of ancient spruce trees, but because the water is so cold, they have not decayed (precisely speaking, the water is about 41 degrees Fahrenheit; anecdotally speaking, I stripped down to my underwear and attempted to go for a swim but only made it about knee-deep before retreating in a flurry of Win Hof-related invectives).</p>

        <p>The night before, I stayed in a guest house in Saty. Pictured here are my roommate (Lasse, from Germany) and a cool dog (did not ask his name, presumably from Kazakhstan).</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Also at the guest house were two families from Kazakhstan, one from China, and another from Spain. At breakfast, a young comrade, Igor, ate sugar by the spoonful. I served as translator and made sure everyone made it onto our Soviet-era bus, which arrived at 8:30am sharp.</p>

        <p>The bus driver pulled up blasting Kazakh party songs. Also on aux were <q>Cheri, Cheri Lady</q> and Gangnam style. The road was bumpy, but the music was bumping-er.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>After reaching the parking lot, we rode on horseback for the last few kilometers to the lake. Being in nature is so rejuvenating. It's a real emotional and mental reset, and a great way to punctuate this trip to Kazakhstan.</p>

        <p>I'll send another email soon about some other outdoor adventures from this weekend. In the meantime, take care everyone!</p>
