        <p>Gamarjoba from the Republic of Georgia! My past week was jam-packed with inspiring, interesting, and heartwarming moments. This is a long email, so I'll get right into it.</p>

        <p>As you probably know, over the past six days, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest the government's <a href="https://civil.ge/archives/638801" target="_blank">decision</a> to temporarily suspend EU ascension talks. Last week, the ruling party also <a href="https://1tv.ge/lang/en/news/gd-nominates-mikheil-kavelashvili-as-presidential-candidate/" target="_blank">nominated</a> a pro-Russia ex-football player as their presidential candidate. Meanwhile, despite massive protests, the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-69007465" target="_blank">passed</a> a <q>Foreign Agents Law</q> in May which expanded their capacity to crack down on pro-democracy groups and NGOs. Finally, the party won a controversial parliamentary election in late October that the EU <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20241121IPR25549/parliament-calls-for-new-elections-in-georgia" target="_blank">called</a> <q>neither free nor fair.</q></p>

        <p>On Rustaveli Avenue, protesters wearing raincoats and swim goggles launched fireworks at police officers armed with water cannons. Further back, demonstrators wrapped in Georgian and EU flags blew horns and shone laser pointers. Cheers erupted with each volley of color that exploded against the limestone walls of the parliament.</p>
        
        <p>While some anti-Russian sentiment was visible, the people I met framed their struggle as more of a fight between democracy and tyranny, an unflinching demand for accountability. Outrage against police <a href="https://transparency.ge/en/post/detained-citizens-are-being-physically-abused" target="_blank">violence</a> further increased turnout. Someone showed me a video of a police officer kicking an already unconscious woman in the head.</p>

        <p>Older folks lamented the ongoing <q>catastrophe,</q> and Shota, who runs a small photography museum in Kutaisi, told me all he wants is peace. He also explained the tension between the country's Christian values and opposition to LGBT+ rights amidst pressure from the EU to <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/congress/-/congress-president-deplores-adoption-of-anti-lgbti-legislation-in-georgia" target="_blank">reform</a>.</p>

        <p>At breakfast this morning, a lively debate ensued between two Greek tourists and a Georgian couple. All four were firmly pro-Trump but had mixed views on Putin. Things quickly escalated when I asked how much Georgia had influenced ancient Greece's culture.</p>
        
        <p>What really made this trip special, though, was meeting my second cousin, Isabella (Belka). She left St. Petersburg a few years ago and now works as an actress and producer in Tbilisi. The last time we saw each other was in Russia when I was two years old. <q>Catching up</q> and hearing her life story was a surreal experience, made all the richer by fresh khachapuri and a liter of semi-sweet red wine. She is truly epic, and it was really special to reconnect.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Belka and I also took a day trip to Kazbegi, a district in northern Georgia nestled in the Caucasus mountains. We visited fortresses, danced at the friendship monument, survived a frozen Marshrutka ride, and tried six types of local honey.</p>

        <p>After returning to Tbilisi, Belka's boyfriend joined for dinner (borscht inside a bread bowlâ€¦life changing), and I met their dog, Bulka, who is blind, has cancer, and has survived at least three bullet wounds. And yet she still wags her tail.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
          <img alt="Belka's dog Bulka" loading="lazy" src="../images-optimized/georgia/bulka.webp"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>Bulka was adopted off the streets a few weeks ago. Georgia has more stray dogs than anywhere I've ever been, and they receive tags when the city vaccinates and neuters them. The dogs, for the most part, are big chillers, and they receive color-coded tags based on how friendly they are.</p>

        <p>As a crazy side note, we met some Turkish guys near Stepantsminda who told us their Kangal puppy, Maya, was a gift for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramzan_Kadyrov" target="_blank">good friend</a> in Chechnya.</p>
        
        <p>Back in Tbilisi, my friend Mariami introduced me to her brother Akaki, who took me to a few places <q>with a great view that describe the Georgian character well,</q> including the Father David cemetery, the Chronicles of Georgia Monument, and Sameba cathedral.</p>

        <p>I later learned the meaning of "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20201124-shemomechama-the-word-for-when-you-cant-stop-eating" target="_blank">shemomechama</a>" (the food was so good that I couldn't help but overeat) after Akaki ordered 20 khinkali for us to share (words cannot describe how good these were).</p>

        <p>On a cloudy day in Mtskheta, Georgia's ancient capital, I visited more monasteries and churches, many of them over 1,500 years old, and listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg8xrdbnH8E" target="_blank">polyphonic Orthodox singing</a>.</p>

        <p>My trip to Georgia ended in Kutaisi, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe, where Jason began his search for the legendary Golden Fleece.</p>

        <p>Last night, I found some cows. I walked backwards and attempted to lure them into a cave to no avail, before hiking along railroad tracks from Gelati Cathedral to the Motsameta monastery.</p>

        <p>Kutaisi<q>s name translates to <q>the city between a stone and a mountain,</q> which is exactly where I found myself after I got lost on my way back. After michvagal</q>ing along the highway in the dark for an hour, I eventually managed to catch a ride back to town.</p>

        <p>I was out cold as soon as my head hit the pillow, but I awoke when my host knocked on my door at 11pm to offer me a glass of homemade wine.</p>

        <p>Before then, though, I have a German exam tomorrow to study for. Wish me luck.</p>
        
        <p>By the way, check out this mummified crocodile and blue hippo from the Kunsthistorisches Museum (well, Egypt technically).</p>
