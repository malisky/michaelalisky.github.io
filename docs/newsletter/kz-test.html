        <p><em>First impressions of Kazakhstan</em></p>
        
        <p>This is my obligatory, "I'm still alive" check-in. I arrived in Almaty this morning at 4am.
           After a bit of small talk, my taxi driver, Alexei, asked if I was okay with a "спорный вопрос"
            (controversial question): "what do Americans think of Trump?" He compared Kazakhstan's aging
             president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, to Joe Biden (unlike Biden though, Tokayev speaks fluent <a href="https://kz.kursiv.media/en/2024-07-01/president-tokayev-reveals-he-speaks-chinese-when-meeting-with-xi-jinping/" target="_blank">Chinese</a>).</p>
        
        <p>Alexei also taught me the word "головоупорный" (hard-headed) to describe how older politicians
           often grow out of touch with the needs of young people.</p>
        
        <p>Almaty has a very Russian feel, with no shortage of randomly placed Soviet statues,
           block-style apartments, and old men wearing oversized suits. Virtually everyone speaks Russian,
            but there've been renewed <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-language-club-russia-ukraine-invasion/32105411.html" target="_blank">efforts</a> to teach Kazakh in recent years.</p>
        
        <p>The city itself is stunning, full of trees and surrounded by the snow-capped Ile-Alatau mountains.
           I love how many parks there are.</p>

        <p>After checking into my apartment, I walked around for a few hours and ran some errands.
           I fed pigeons with an older woman from the North Caucasus, who informed me that Kazakh pigeons 
           most strongly prefer pearl barley.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>I also stumbled on the vestigial remains of McDonalds, which arrived in Kazakhstan
           in 2016 but <a href="https://eurasianet.org/not-lovin-it-russias-war-forces-mcdonalds-out-of-kazakhstan#:~:text=McDonald's%20was%20%E2%80%9Cset%20to%20abandon,January%204%2C%20citing%20anonymous%20sources." target="_blank">left</a> in 2022 due to supply chain issues caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It looks like someone else is not so subtly using their branding.</p>

        <p>Also, my apartment's bed sheets match the walls, which I find very endearing.</p>
